00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,639
How did Castlevania go from being a...

71
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,642
a beloved video game series
that was kind of dead

72
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,102
to a Netflix show
that became, like, a hit?

73
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,028
So I had this career making films.

74
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,197
Some of them ended up in theaters,
some did very well.

75
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,532
I wasn't really into the movies.

76
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,661
What I was really into
was making fan films on the Internet.

77
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,705
There was a Power Rangers one
and a James Bond one

78
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,832
that I released a week apart.

79
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,836
And, yeah, some of them went, uh,
kind of nuclear viral.

80
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,841
And it's been interesting, you know.
I never looked at my career in this light,

81
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,137
but then I had a rapper explain it
to me this way.

82
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,640
He just called me up.
He's like, "Yo, what up? It's Kanye."

83
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,309
I'm like, "Huh, what? Hello?"
Then we, like, met.

84
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:33,398
Rappers consider that my mixtape,
which makes me feel very cool.

85
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,025
Because I look at that as just fan films,
which is less cool.

86
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:41,281
So, fan films led
to Netflix tweeting at me.

87
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,075
Yeah, actually there was a tweet,
saying, "Hey, come in for a meeting."

88
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,663
And that directly led
to <i>Castlevania</i> happening.

89
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,503
When I was growing up,
all the things I loved,

90
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,381
I had no idea
that other people liked any of it.

91
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,719
It wasn't cool. You know,
people would pretend they didn't...

92
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,346
Like people who liked it
would pretend like they didn't like it.

93
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,058
And now, it's, like,
people are cosplaying as Goku.

94
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,395
It's awesome. I mean, I literally
have a power glove that I wear.

95
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:13,980
It lights up.

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,357
When I was growing up in Hong Kong,
there would be, like,

97
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,236
this crazy, awesome anime on TV
and it was never in English.

98
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,990
So, like, I didn't know what was going on,
but I loved the way it looked.

99
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,075
I was like, "Well, one day,
we're gonna make our own,

100
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,912
and it's gonna look just like that."
From the moment Netflix said, "Yes,

101
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,709
go make your crazy anime adaptation
of this video game.

102
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,711
Go do it, go for it..."

103
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,798
Then, uh, both Kevin and I,
Kevin is my partner on the show,

104
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,677
we kind of looked at each other.
It had to be 2D.

105
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,307
It had to be that hand-drawn style,
again that was an homage to those OVAs,

106
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,102
those OVAs that I would watch
on TV in Hong Kong that I loved

107
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,104
and I was like, "This is beautiful.
It's an art form."

108
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,984
My family says my work is very violent.

109
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,612
It's very violent.

110
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,950
Uh, this is Mooshi. She's human,

111
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,203
so she, like,
literally understands English.

112
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,542
I do always get this reaction
and it kind of weirds me out.

113
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,296
Whenever people see Mooshi, they're like,
"Is this your dog?" I'm like, "Yes."

114
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,841
They're like, "You picked this dog?
This wasn't a girlfriend's?"

115
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,177
I was like, "No! This was, like,
the dog I always wanted."

116
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,305
And they're like, "This is not..."
I always get the same response.

117
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,766
"This is not the dog
that I would see you with."

118
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,936
And then I'm like,
"What? What are you talking about?

119
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,063
What kind of dog
are you imagining me having? Like...

120
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,023

00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,045
I think being around other artists
and creatives who are...

169
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,131
really good and better at things than I am
really inspire me.

170
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,677
I'm a big fan of collaboration,

171
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,845
which is why I'm attracted
to the animation production.

172
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,557
I like working in a room
full of really, really gifted people.

173
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,225
It forces me to keep my game up.

174
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,229
So I started off consuming
Japanese animated TV shows

175
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,899
through VHS tapes illegally recorded
in locations in Chinatown.

176
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,818
And it was very niche at the time.

177
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,197
I would say I took everything,
a little bit of everything that I loved

178
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,615
to create <i>Cannon Busters.</i>

179
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:41,038
The music in <i>Cannon Busters</i> is, uh, a mix
of jazz, philharmonic score and pop music.

180
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,665
<i>♪ Playing with fire ♪</i>

181
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,836
<i>Cannon Busters'</i> style is influenced
by an amalgamation of things

182
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,424
that I was consuming as a young kid
in the '90s and in the early '80s.

183
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,052
Road shows, adventure shows,
Japanese role playing games,

184
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,971
<i>Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana.</i>

185
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,641
This project was a perfect opportunity
to combine all those elements.

186
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,436
My favorite character
for <i>Cannon Busters</i> is Sam,

187
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,022
which is an acronym
for Special Associate Model.

188
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,025
And she's a royal,
high-profile friendship robot.

189
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,154
She's a bit OCD, she's pure,
she only sees the good in people.

190
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,699
No, there are no characters
in <i>Cannon Busters</i> that are based on me.

191
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,119
I'm not really one of those creatives
that puts myself in my work.

192
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,456
I quite like creating distance
between myself and the audience.

193
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,000
I feel like as an American,
Japanese animation,

194
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,254
as a medium, as an art form
is a truly trans-genre medium.

195
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,466
They have animation content for toddlers

196
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,928
to young boys and girls
to teens to adults to porn.

197
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,973
I don't feel like an outsider,
I feel like a visitor,

198
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,558
a guest, if you will.

199
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,355
Japanese animation was my gateway
to Japanese culture.

200
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,358
It was the thing that I was absorbing
since I was a kid

201
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,070
and I knew all about Tokyo through
Japanese animation and comic books

202
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,905
before I even visited here.

203

218
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,379

221
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:08,769
[in Japanese] During the anime boom,
animators were, how to put it...

222
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,898
not stars, but something like that.
They were idolized.

223
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,734
I am an animator in my roots.

224
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,903
I started as an animator
and became a director among other things.

225
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,364
Where do you begin creating anime?

226
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,491
People call them good scenes.

227
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,078
You first make scenes
that become the keystones.

228
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,124
For <i>Baki,</i>
that's the fighters' special poses.

229
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,126
Stuff like that.

230
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,097
[Yoshida] The best scenes in fighting
are the KOs.

231
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,850
It just looks good
when they have a clean execution.

232
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,937
For anime, you first put images
like that in your head

233
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,773
and build around them.

234
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,818
Since I'm an animator, I first think
about what I want to show the most.

235
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,529
That's kind of how it goes.
After that, I glue everything else to it.

236
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,781
[inaudible]

237
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,580
When you're creating film based on manga,

238
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,249
breaking it apart
and rebuilding is the way to go.

239
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:16,712
But for <i>Baki, </i>we thought about sticking
to the manga. That part was set in stone.

240
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
When did you decide to work in anime?

241
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,884
I never wanted to work in anime.

242
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,094
-You never wanted to?
-I wanted to be a manga artist.

243
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,262
Is that so?

244
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,646
[Yoshida] So do you often visit
Mandarake shops?

245
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,857
[Hirano] I go occasionally,
as TMS is located in Nakano,

246
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,527
and there is a Mandarake shop there.

247
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,404
[Yoshida] So it's like a mecca there.
You have the studio,

248
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,032
and the original Mandarake nearby.

249
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,117
-[Hirano] Yes.
-[Yoshida] What do you look at there?

250
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,454
[Hirano] Well, I look at the figures
and used books.

251
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,790
You see, there aren't
that many bookstores nowadays.

252
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,707
[Yoshida] Indeed.

253
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,168
[Hirano] For manga, you have to go
to manga shops to buy them.

254
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,337
Or even look at them. So I just have to.

255
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,298
[Yoshida] And the size
of their archives is staggering.

256
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,844
When do you come up with ideas?

257
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,387
Usually in the shower.

258
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,724
Well, when you are,
you can't take notes, can you?

259
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,727
Right. So I hurry out to jot things down.

260
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,689
-Oh, really?
-Yes, or I'd forget.

261
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,568
So you're drawing scenes buck naked...?

262
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,530
Not really. I do dry myself. A quick work
of the towel, then off with the pen.

263
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,489
Rough sketches?

264
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,702
-More like short memos.
-Memos straight out of the shower.

265
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,871

"Netflix."

And now you've become

for the series?

271

00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:18,282
<i>that he wanted to create</i>
<i>an entire series from just CG.</i>

331
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:24,204
<i>Basically, the main component</i>
<i>of </i>Kengan Ashura<i> are the fighters' bodies</i>

332
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,291
<i>so I think it was something like,</i>

333
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,710
<i>"How about we draw muscles</i>
<i>like how we draw armor?"</i>

334
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,044
<i>I was sold.</i>

335
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,924
<i>Mr. Kishi said that when people</i>
<i>were done watching </i>Kengan Ashura,

336
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,094
<i>he didn't want them to think</i>
<i>they watched a CG movie</i>

337
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,014
<i>but feel they watched</i>
<i>an ordinary Japanese anime.</i>

338
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,891
<i>He wanted visual expressions</i>
<i>like regular anime</i>

339
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,434
<i>so nobody would realize that it's CG.</i>

340
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,604
<i>I believe that was his theme.</i>

341
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,322
This series is,
in one word, about fighting.

342
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,200
It's uncommon for animation,
so you could say it's unique.

343
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,534
My inspiration?

344
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:08,582
They really come to me
when I'm least thinking about it.

345
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,960
I get ideas during everyday life,
like when I'm taking a bath.

346
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,213
Ideas really spring to life
during times like that.

347
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,721
I do work out at the gym.

348
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,683
I do make an effort to go and work out.

349
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,063
Japanese animation is a hand-made 3D art.

350
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,607
That kind of animation
is what the industry has developed into.

351
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,026
So I wanted to try it out for this series.

352
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,154
About whether or not
it's rough for my staff?

353
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,698
Well, it's rough.
It really is tough for them.

354
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,077
They hand-create the art
for each and every frame.

355
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,705
In that aspect, I feel the final project
really screams out "Made in Japan."

356
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,540
I met all the martial artists

357
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,335
who participated for the first time
with this project.

358
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,426
We all went to the original Gold's Gym
in Los Angeles one morning.

359
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,179
When we did, we just happened
to meet Schwarzenegger.

360
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,891
We were able to shake hands with him,
and he okayed taking a picture with us.

361
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,351
[cheering]

362
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,353
[heavy metal music playing]

363
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,449
[man] We went to Anime Expo.

364
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,995
Our director went to Gold's Gym,
and was able to meet Schwarzenegger.

365
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,913
[man 2] Where were you at the time,
Mr. Higa?

366
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,915
[man] At Gold's Gym, obviously!

367
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:47,681
We actually have real martial artists
fight out the combat scenes on this floor.

368
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,809
We then take their footage as the base
for drawing each frame of CG.

369
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,730
We really had them punching and kicking.

370
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,775
We then controlled the speed
to make it look more awesome.

371
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,778
We're creating the CG by hand.
It's not motion-capture.

372
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,948
We didn't put devices on the fighters
like you do in motion-capture.

373
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,034
We create each combat scene by hand.

374
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,369
That's the director's concept
we're running with.

375
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,417
What I don't like about our director...

376
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,835
Well, he's a bit...

377
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,380
How should I say this? What should I do?

378
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,258
What I don't like
is actually what I love about him.

379
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,176
[laughs]

380
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,636

382
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,848
Mr. Kishi really is insane.

383
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,434
So everyone else around him
starts becoming dumber and dumber.

384
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,770
[Higa] Children are waiting for our anime!

385
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,355

<i>It's for kids.</i>

394
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,889
<i>It's the country's Disney,</i>
<i>except instead of a mouse,</i>

<i>they've got a cat.</i>

396
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,184
<i>Suck it, Disney.</i>

397
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,270
<i>If you were a kid in Japan,</i>
<i>you were raised on Toei.</i>

398
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,572
[in Japanese] Japanese animation,
that is Toei Animation,

399
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:34,413
started right after Japan lost the war.
It was based on Disney.

400
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,291
It was a brand-new industry.

401
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,170
It was a way to give kids hope
after losing the war.

402
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,757
That's how Toei Animation began.

403
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,689
Yes, I'll definitely be watching.

404
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,025
I've watched Toei Animation
for a long time.

405
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,113
For example, <i>Slamdunk,</i>
<i>Dragon Ball Z, Digimon.</i>

406
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,240
I do some illustrating myself,

407
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:15,912
so I watch it like a student would,
for my own drawings.

408
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,959
[robotic voice, in English] <i>Awesome move.</i>

409
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,296
[in Japanese]
Since they're making it with CGI,

410
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,758
there might be some former fans
who won't be able to accept it,

411
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,597
but the way I see it, it's for the sake
of the younger generation,

412
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,807
so I'm interested to see
how it will turn out.

413
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:41,229
That's why Toei Animation's
target audience is always kids.

414
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,316
That's why they make anime
that makes them happy.

415
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,110
And that's something
they shouldn't stray from.

416
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:54,159
I really love the phrase
"Friendship, Effort, Victory."

417
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:59,289
How to teach that to kids
is where the love in anime is.

418
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,374
[robotic voice, in English]
<i>That's radical.</i>

[man, in Japanese] Do you have COSMO?

420
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,509
I'm already 70 so it's almost gone,
but it's still there.

421
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,178
When a movie is done,

422
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:18,934
or when I finish a TV show,
I am liberated from stress.

423
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,269
Until then, I'm a clump of stress.

424
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,981
I'd guess it's the COSMO
that keeps me creating anime.

00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,650
This is how we go about creating
stop-motion animation.

529
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,404
The first thing we have to do is

530
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,032
assemble everything
that appears on camera.

531
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,328
First we make the puppets,
create the artwork, create the rooms.

532
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,830
In this case, create the puppets
for Rilakkuma and the humans.

533
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,833
And then, we start moving the puppets.

534
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,633
As for how long it takes
to create stop-motion animation,

535
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:54,430
it takes a whole day for a single animator
to shoot ten seconds.

536
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,018

[groans]

539
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,613
The reason why Kaoru needs Rilakkuma

540
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:17,620
is because he's so soft and warm,
and I think she can't give him up.

541
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:23,626
I don't think
that Kaoru's really struggling in life.

542
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,255
I think there's a time
when every one of us

543
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,799
feels like nothing's going right.

544
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:34,679
So, I think it goes to show
that Kaoru is just normal,

545
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,848
like the rest of us.

546
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,768
I think it's important to take it easy

547
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,354
because if you keep yourself too busy,

548
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:48,735
you might end up forgetting
to be nice to others.

[Kobayashi] About the seasons,

561
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:51,547
we calculated the sun's position
over 12 months to create the lighting.

562
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:55,092
We also used snow and cherry blossoms
to illustrate the seasons.

563
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:02,517
[Ogigami] I wanted everyone to be able
to relate to her.

564
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,063
This was the first time we used
stop-motion animation

565
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,276
so I knew we could do things
that we never could with live-action

566
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,240
so I wanted to let my imagination
run wild, to explode,

567
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,244

to a totally different world.

00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,531
Actually, the conditions are different,

663
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:19,119
but I feel similar things are happening
in our world and their world.

664
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,872
During the creative process,

665
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,793
as we draw out
how the protagonists behave,

666
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:29,922
and as I'm directing their movements,
it felt like this was actually present day

667
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:34,552
and that their situation was similar
to the one that we've been put into.

668
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:49,650
I think it's a great series
with characters that stand out.

669
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,278
<i>7SEEDS</i> is a really interesting series!

670
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,029
I really love <i>7SEEDS!</i>

671
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,073
<i>7SEEDS</i> is so interesting! It's the best!

672
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,450
[both] <i>7SEEDS!</i>

673
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:03,581
The reason why <i>7SEEDS</i>
is so popular among females

674
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:08,502
is because each female character
is powerful in different ways

675
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,172
and the male characters can be either kind
or strong.

676
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,135
I believe each character is very appealing
in their own way.

677
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,016
The meaning of "7SEEDS"
is literally that of seven seeds.

678
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:27,479
Each of the boys and girls
sent to the future is a "seed."

679
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,983
Where 7SEEDS differs
from other girls' manga is how,

680
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,111
unlike most girls' manga
that focus on romance,

681
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,904
this series takes a different approach

682
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,533
and talks about a deeper theme
of survival.

683
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,044
If I was not a part
of the animation industry,

684
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,255
I believe I would be
doing something related to astronomy.

685
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,927
[narrator, in English] <i>Astronomy.</i>

686
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,805
<i>All these anime creators</i>
<i>seem to have a backup plan.</i>

687
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,558
<i>I need a backup plan.</i>

688
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,186
<i>What should it be?</i>

689
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,733
[in Japanese] I used to want to be a chef.

690
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,613
I think I'd be really good at it.

691
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,741
If I wasn't in the animation business?

692
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,409
That's a very dangerous question.

693
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,786
[laughs]

694
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,539
[narrator, in English]
<i>A dangerous question, indeed.</i>

695
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:32,670
<i>Because the life of a creator is no walk</i>
<i>in one of Japan's clean, green parks.</i>

696
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,631
<i>It can be soul-crushing.</i>

697
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,634
<i>Anxiety-inducing. All-consuming.</i>

698
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,180
<i>And, I was coming to realize,</i>
<i>incredibly lonely.</i>

699
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,891
Would I move to Tokyo forever?

700
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,936
No. I miss my family too much.

701
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:56,026
[in Japanese] Since I was a student,
I'd be working 20 hours straight every day

702
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,445
making movies
while running myself into the ground.

703
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:04,410
Creating anything in film
turns you into a clump of stress.

704
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:08,455
If I had free time,
I'd sleep six hours a day.

705
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,749
[in English] Animation production,
it's  hard to get a lot of free time.

706
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,875
Everyone's so busy.

707
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,169
[in Japanese] If I had free time...

708
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,924
I would like to sleep. [chuckles]

709
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,259
[man] Your next step?

710
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,388
To live an easy life?

711
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,604
[narrator, in English] <i>Hedgehog wrangling.</i>
<i>That's gonna be my backup.</i>

712
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,441
<i>I was starting to doubt everything.</i>

713
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,818
<i>My decision to come to Japan.</i>

714
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,570
<i>My ability to tell this story.</i>

715
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:44,158
<i>All of these anime creators</i>
<i>started to seem so distant.</i>

716
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,326
<i>How do they keep going,</i>
<i>running on no sleep</i>

717
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,954
<i>and having to come up</i>
<i>with creative innovation?</i>

718
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,207
<i>Especially the ones</i>
<i>who have been doing this for decades.</i>

719
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,966
[in Japanese] When I was singing
<i>Ultraman's</i> song for my son,

720
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,051
he asked me, "What's that song?"

721
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:07,055
I said, "This is <i>Ultraman's</i> song."
Then he started loving <i>Ultraman.</i>

722
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,559
We watched old series and new series.

723
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,228
We both love <i>Ultraman. Ultraman</i> pose.

724
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,313
[yells]

725
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,233
I used to want to design cars.

726
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:27,034
I think I'd like to have done that
for a living.

727
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:37,878
The first thing I ever directed
was <i>Madox-01.</i>

728
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:44,468
It was a short, 40-minute
original video animation, OVA.

729
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:51,141
The first show I directed
was <i>Patlabor Minimum,</i>

730
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:56,271
these short movies that accompany
the OP for a show called <i>Patlabor.</i>

731
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,775
I did hand-drawn animation for decades.

732
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,318
Then something came along

733
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,154
that would bring out both our designs
and worldviews even more,

734
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:10,494
like computer graphics.
It was all over the news,

735
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:14,873
and I thought,
"This is the way to go from now on."

736
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,460
Without a doubt, that would be
the first <i>APPLESEED </i>movie.

737
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:22,506
It was my first time using motion capture,

738
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,883
and rendering everything in 3DCG.

739
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,762
I think I've been involved with
<i>Ghost in the Shell</i> the longest.

740
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,640
There were two series, after all.

741
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,768
I also made
one feature-length theatrical film.

742
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:40,566
<i>Eden of the East</i>
was my first completely original title.

743
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:45,779
One of the films that I spent
a lot of time on was <i>Captain Harlock,</i>

744
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,948
a full CG film.

745
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:54,454
I think it took more than five years
to complete.

746
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,002
[Kamiyama]
I don't remember all the details,

747
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:04,798
but I think Mr. Aramaki initially wanted
to create

748
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,552
a different <i>Ghost in the Shell </i>series.

749
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,554
It was at a party,

750
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,640
and producer Ishikawa
happened to be sitting next to me.

751
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,351
I thought I'd just ask him
for the heck of it,

752
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,477
since he was right there.

753
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,938
So, it was decided that Mr. Aramaki and I

754
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,691
would make
a <i>Ghost in the Shell </i>series together.

755
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:29,031
But we were both directing other projects,

756
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:35,037
and we couldn't get started right away,

757
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,084
but there was another project
in the works.

758
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:46,882
It was <i>Ultraman </i>and they offered it to us.

759
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,425
[rock music playing]

760
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,060
Since we're both from the generation

761
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,312
that grew up watching
the first <i>Ultraman </i>shows,

762
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,273
we were both really passionate about it.

763
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,693
In terms of visuals, sure...

764
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:12,741
jaw-dropping action scenes
are great and all,

765
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,578
but since the CG is motion capture-based,

766
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:22,209
the humans look more human

767
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,337
as well as more raw.

768
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,425
It's that fusion of human rawness
and anime's deformé style

769
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:35,097
that I want to pursue to the limit.

770
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,436
[narrator, in English] <i>I was starting</i>
<i>to feel like I'd hit my limit,</i>

771
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,647
<i>which was hard to do in Tokyo,</i>

772
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,525
<i>which feels like a place</i>
<i>where limits don't exist.</i>

773
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,819
<i>From vending machine restaurants...</i>

774
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,780
<i>to bullet trains...</i>

775
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,242
<i>to the most confusing, high-tech toilets</i>
<i>the world has ever seen.</i>

776
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,159
[toilet flushes]

777
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,453
<i>Japan is already living in the future.</i>

778
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,375
<i>It's all about full automation...</i>
<i>especially in animation.</i>

779
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,630
[in Japanese] I really can't stand
the repetitive tasks.

780
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:13,051
I wish we could use computers

781
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,177
for all of that.

782
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,315
[phones ringing]

783
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,321
3DCG involves numerous processes

784
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:39,494
and elements to produce visuals.

785
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,540
Now, I'd like to explain each process
to you.

786
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,505
This is part of an animatic.

787
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:56,595
This raw data allows us to experiment
so we can figure out

788
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,598
how we can create the powerful scenes
we have in our heads.

789
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,601
Then, you start the modeling process.

790
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,905
[Seshita] I wanted the fist to get
smashed more and sink into the flesh.

791
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:19,201
And I wanted the place where it landed
to bulge out here.

792
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,662
This is an effect.

793
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:27,000
Here you can see the impact of the punch
is so powerful,

794
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:32,756
the steam inside this muscle
is leaking out.

795
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,633
I really want it to come out from
the crack,

796
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:38,553
but it would be so much work
to make it come out from the crack.

797
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,263
So, the steam emerges from the surface.

798
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,849
You can tell
that we're cheating this shot.

799
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,145
As for the lighting,

800
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:52,109
the reason I have so much light
hitting the ring

801
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:57,656
is because I wanted to create a sense
of flashing during the characters' fight.

802
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:02,202
The characters' emotions are linked
to the color of the light.

803
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,206
I was hung up on using the flashing

804
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:10,252
in an effective way.

805
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:16,550
My goal isn't so much about
reproducing Japan's anime in 3DCG.

806
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,219
But, rather, I'd like to take
the American comics, graphic novels,

807
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,179
bandes dessinées that I love so much...

808
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:26,017
and find a way to somehow
set them in motion in that style.

809
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,436
That's my goal.

810
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:36,486
A director has three jobs.
Three truly basic jobs:

811
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:41,366
To have a vision. To choose. To decide.

812
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:45,036
[narrator, in English]
<i>Yeah, I didn't know what to do.</i>

813
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,498
<i>Guess we'll have to get to anime's essence</i>
<i>the hard way.</i>

814
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,459
<i>I'm sending in backup.</i>
<i>It's an interrogation.</i>

815
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,881
-[man, in Japanese] Name?
-Rui Kuroki.

816
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,841
-[man] Age?
-[Kuroki] Forty-one.

817
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,467
-[man] Hometown?
-[Kuroki] Tokyo.

818
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,220
-[man] Dislikes?
-Getting older.

819
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,320
[man] What did you eat for lunch?

820
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,239
-[Kuroki] I haven't eaten.
-[man] Why is that?

821
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,449
[Kuroki] I don't have time.

822
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,327
-[man] Who do you work for?
-For myself.

823
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,747
-[man] How did you get here?
-By car.

824
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,333
-[man] Any pets?
-No.

825
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,335
-[man] Dogs or cats?

[inaudible]

863
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,863
[narrator, in English]
<i>Turns out I did need this quest</i>

864
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,031
<i>to understand anime,</i>

865
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,199
<i>not to be a better filmmaker.</i>

866
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,619
<i>It's about acceptance, inspiration,</i>

867
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,748
<i>and something these anime creators</i>
<i>knew all along.</i>

868
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,542
<i>The contradictions of Japan</i>
<i>aren't confusing.</i>

869
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,501
<i>They're vital.</i>

870
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,130
<i>Relax in the chaos</i>
<i>and the great ideas just flow.</i>

871
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,465
How do I come up with my ideas?

872
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:47,469
[in Japanese] I get ideas during
everyday life, like when I take a bath.

873
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,512
Bath time.

874
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,432
It can be when I'm in the bath...

875
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,225
[Hirano] Usually in the shower.

876
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:59,939
They hit me at all times,
like when I'm taking a walk.

877
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,900
The commute home.

878
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,153
...or just strolling around the area.

879
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:09,616
Ideas don't pick a place or time.

880
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,871
[narrator, in English]
<i>So, the question is not, "What is anime?"</i>

881
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,542
<i>How it's made, why it's made,</i>

882
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,127
<i>what makes the fans love it?</i>

883
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:26,257
<i>It's not just the people who create it:</i>
<i>the idea-makers, the dreamers,</i>

884
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,511
<i>the visionaries who have the guts to say,</i>
<i>"I don't give a fuck."</i>

885
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,181
<i>The thing that unifies anime</i>
<i>and makes it special...</i>

886
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:38,103
<i>is the way it makes you a part</i>
<i>of something bigger than yourself.</i>

887
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,524
<i>How it accepts you</i>
<i>into this crazy community.</i>

888
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,693
<i>And the way it makes you feel</i>
<i>like you're not alone.</i>

889
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:50,281
<i>Made by misfits for other misfits.</i>

890
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,661
It didn't matter what school
I went to in what country.

891
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,830
If I saw someone
who wore a Wolverine T-shirt,

892
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,374
I was like,
"I can talk to this dude about X-Men."

893
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,961
Right? And that was a way
to connect across cultures.

894
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,756
[narrator] <i>The veil has been lifted.</i>

895
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,884
<i>Enter the anime.</i>

896
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,352
[futuristic electronic music playing]
