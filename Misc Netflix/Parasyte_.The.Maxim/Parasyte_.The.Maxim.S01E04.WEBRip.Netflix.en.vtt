00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've only cut off your escape route.

3
00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:13.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you cannot win.

Aside from your right hand,

7
00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
your entire body is useless,

8
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

9
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you become flustered and hold me back,

10
00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we will lose.

15

<i>They're so fast, I can't see anything.</i>

16
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Can I really do this?</i>

17
00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We delegate roles.

18
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:29.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll pretend to attack,
but I'll focus on defense.

19
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That'll make my defense
practically impenetrable.

20
00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then, who's going to attack?

21
00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That'll have to be you, of course.

22
00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me?

23
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What A's actions thus far have told me

24
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is that he underestimates human ability.

25
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A will be cautious toward me,

26
00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he most likely will not have
factored in your abilities at all.

27
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is our advantage.

28
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will be defense and you will be offense.

29
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is the most effective
delegation of roles.

30
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

35
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

37
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

38
00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

41
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It's either him or us.</i>

42
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is this pipe?

43
00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A table leg?

44
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We did it.

45
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That much blood means it's fatal.

46
00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impossible.

47
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The weak, cowardly human attacked?

48
00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait.

49
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what he'll do.

50
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He seems to be in turmoil.

51
00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He got an artery close to the heart.</i>

53
00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pushing the pipe through his back
gets rid of the "spout".

55
00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

56
00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

57
00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

58
00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:02.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

59
00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

60
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we shouldn't leave him like that.

61
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:20.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you be able to kill that baby?

109
00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamiya Ryoko is no more.

110
00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, there is no particular reason
to keep the humans around me,

111
00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:35.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
including you, alive.

112
00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you kill people?

113
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My right hand is being kept alive
by my blood.

114
00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means it's surviving
on normal food for humans.

115
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shouldn't the rest of you be able
to live without eating humans, too?

116
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's possible, I suppose.

117
00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then…

118
00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:56.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flies know how to fly
without being taught.

119
00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:01.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spiders know how to spin webs
without being taught.

120
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:02.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is that?

121
00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's…

122
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's what I think.

123
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flies and spiders are simply
following a directive.

124
00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:16.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe all life on Earth
has received a directive of some kind.

125
00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:19.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you get it?

127
00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So humans have no directive?

128
00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:27.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like I said, what are you talking about?

129
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean, like, from a god?

130
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:33.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I took over this human's brain,

131
00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I received a directive.

132
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It said, "Devour this species."

133
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell me one thing.

134
00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:06.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The child you're carrying,
what will you do with it?

135
00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give birth to it.

136
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure I can use it in some experiment.

137
00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I have no use for it, I'll eat it.

138
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Calm down, Shinichi!

139
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should not engage at this distance.

140
00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're getting on my nerves.

141
00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:25.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Die.

142
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit!

143
00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As I thought, she has at least
two morph patterns.

144
00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:37.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not good.

145
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although it's minimal,
you're no longer pure.

146
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Interesting.

147
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't kill you, after all.

148
00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

149
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ryoko!

150
00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:13.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on with you?

151
00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:16.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got a call from your school,
so I rushed over!

152
00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:20.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She must be Tamiya Ryoko's mother.</i>

153
00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, but I have somewhere I need to be.

154
00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we talk about this later?

155
00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ryoko.

156
00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:32.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nearby, so I'll be back soon.

157
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:34.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait!

158
00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:37.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turn around!

159
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who…

160
00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who are you?

161
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It… It can't be.

162
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No!

163
00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ryoko.

164
00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:59.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is Ryoko?

165
00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is she?

166
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where did you put her?

167
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no! I have to call the police!

168
00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:20.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She saw through me in mere moments.</i>

169
00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:25.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>My face and voice should be practically</i>
<i>indistinguishable from Tamiya Ryoko, yet…</i>

170
00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:27.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I don't understand.</i>

171
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I doubt this woman</i>

172
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Migi?

173
00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't scare me, Shinichi.

174
00:12:57.526 --> 00:12:59.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? You…

175
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the matter? Why did you yell?

176
00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh… A dream! I had a dream!

177
00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Man, it was horrible.

178
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:10.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go splash some water on your face.

179
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you doing?

180
00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:18.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, at most, it's only three minutes
that I can separate from you.

181
00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:20.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was that? A morning walk?

182
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a walk.

183
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a mobility experiment.

184
00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mobility?

185
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute.
Are you going to take over my head?

186
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you I can't do that.

187
00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:31.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that I've matured
without eating a brain,

188
00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:34.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
how to control the entire body.

189
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But perhaps I should give it a try,
regardless?

190
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was just joking.

191
00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:41.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, hang on.

192
00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:43.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So those of you
who've taken over the brain

193
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
can technically swap heads?

194
00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In theory, yes.

195
00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:49.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But there can be rejection,

196
00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:51.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and besides,
swapping heads is too dangerous.

197
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:54.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I doubt anyone would bother.

198
00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A trip?

199
00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:02.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I can finally take some time off.

200
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:04.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be holding down the fort
for a while.

201
00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your father's such a workaholic.

202
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've barely gone on any trips together.

203
00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But isn't that risky?

204
00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:14.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean because of the Mincemeat Murders?

205
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There haven't been as many recently,

206
00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I don't think
there's any need to worry.

207
00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's just
what it looks like on the surface.

208
00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why wander around somewhere
you've never been in times like these?

209
00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you against it?

210
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:32.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

211
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't tell me you think
you'll be too lonely staying home

212
00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even though you're in 12th grade.

213
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not it!

214
00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not the reason! It's that they…

215
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:41.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"They"?

216
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind.

217
00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:47.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shinichi, if you're really against it,
we can cancel.

218
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come now, honey.

219
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's something that's been
bothering me for a while.

220
00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:56.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is there something troubling you?

221
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, nothing really.

222
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of your friends, maybe? Or…

223
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing, okay?

224
00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have to go to school.

225
00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:12.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shinichi.
I shouldn't need to remind you, but…

226
00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:14.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

227
00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:19.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If I told my parents about my right hand,</i>

228
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>there's no telling what Migi might do.</i>

229
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:28.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He only tries to protect me</i>
<i>because I am his lifeline.</i>

230
00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But my parents are a different story.</i>

231
00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He'll get rid of them</i>
<i>without a moment's hesitation.</i>

232
00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:37.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Migi is not capable of affection.</i>

233
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>When it comes down to it,</i>

234
00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Migi is no different</i>
<i>from A or Tamiya Ryoko.</i>

235
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's hiding something.

236
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:49.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course he is.

237
00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's in 12th grade.

238
00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would only be natural for him
to be keeping a few secrets from us.

239
00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:59.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hell, I'd say he's been
too good of a kid until now.

240
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He didn't even really
have a rebellious phase.

241
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

242
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:15.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be because of that scar,
actually.

243
00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:18.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Surely not.

244
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:21.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was so long ago.

245
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Mom! Give me a silver plate!

246
00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:27.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Silver plate?

247
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to use it for
a science experiment in class tomorrow!

248
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:33.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, by silver,
you mean the aluminum foil plates?

249
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:34.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, those!

250
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, they're up on top of that,

251
00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm making tempura right now,

252
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-so wait until I'm done--
-I can get it!

253
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hang on, Shinichi.

254
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:51.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Watch out!

255
00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:55.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ouch!

256
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you all right, Shinichi?
Did any oil get on you?

257
00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:07.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing hot hit you?

258
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you get burned?

259
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

260
00:17:10.904 --> 00:17:12.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobuko, your hand.

261
00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:13.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

262
00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:20.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ouch.

263
00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your mom's hurting more.

264
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? So I shouldn't be that worried?

265
00:17:30.257 --> 00:17:32.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Consider the probability.

266
00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:36.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My kind tends to congregate
in urban areas where food is plentiful.

267
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:39.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not to mention,
they tend to target solitary individuals.

268
00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the two of them are taking
a trip to the countryside,

269
00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:43.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they should be even safer
than they are now.

270
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

271
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I guess I shouldn't
have been so against it.

272
00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:49.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

273
00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

274
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were you talking to someone just now?

275
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just to myself! What did you need, anyway?

276
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:59.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, dinner's almost ready.

277
00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

278
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be down in a bit.

279
00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, and Mom?

280
00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:08.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please knock before you open
the door next time!

281
00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:10.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't forget, okay?

282
00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:13.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

283
00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:15.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

284
00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I was going to
have a heart attack.

285
00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A heart attack?

286
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would be inconvenient.

287
00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi yelled at me.

288
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? Was he spanking
the monkey or something?

289
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:39.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I said this morning
that I was against your trip,

290
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I take that back.

291
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's good to get away
from the crowd sometimes

292
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and go relax somewhere with fresh air.

293
00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:51.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, when do you leave?

294
00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't get it.
-Huh?

295
00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:01.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't get you, Shinichi.

296
00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:05.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on with you?

297
00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:08.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were so against it this morning.

298
00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:10.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was that about?

299
00:19:10.357 --> 00:19:13.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now, you've done a total 180!

300
00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:16.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So now, you don't even care
about your parents?

301
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not true.

302
00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:20.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom, what's up with you?

303
00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't get it.

304
00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't get what's going on with you!

305
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something's… Something's changed.

306
00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:29.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like…

307
00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like you're not my son.

308
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:32.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobuko.

309
00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please tell me!

310
00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:38.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's happened to you?

311
00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:43.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

312
00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:52.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought I'd be lonely.

313
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least, I did this morning.

314
00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:58.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when I talked to my friends about it,
they laughed at me.

315
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I thought things over.

316
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I'm fine now.

317
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I get lonely,
I can just invite a friend over.

318
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's really all it was.

319
00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's enough, right?

320
00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:24.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They said it'd be a while
before the taxi arrives.

321
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, this might be the first time
we've been gone for so long.

322
00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:36.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Back when we lived in an apartment,
we didn't have that luxury.

323
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Things were tough back then.

324
00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:42.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come to think of it,
