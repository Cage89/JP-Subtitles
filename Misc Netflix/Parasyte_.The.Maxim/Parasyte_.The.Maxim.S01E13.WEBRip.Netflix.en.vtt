Hey, Izumi-kun.

2
00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you hear about that incident,

3
00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:11.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you know, the girl who was recently
murdered in a neighboring town?

4
00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I heard about that!

5
00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been making the rounds online!

6
00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I heard you were the first one
to find the victim, Izumi-kun!

7
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Akiho!

8
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You okay?

9
00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:54.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. You?

10
00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm okay, too.

11
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, um…

12
00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

13
00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That day when we had planned
to go see a movie…

14
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I…

15
00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:16.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's awful when so many sad things happen.

16
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:23.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

AUTHOR: HITOSHI IWAAKI

18
00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Regardless of all these
dining locations we prepared,

19
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
he intentionally fed outside
of the designated areas

20
00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and was killed.

21
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An unfortunate incident, indeed.

22
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He gave in to the immediacy of hunger,

23
00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then squabbled with his own kind.

24
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How self-centered. Just like animals.

25
00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm glad he's dead.

26
00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not that simple.

27
00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The end result is that we have provided
humans with another sample

28
00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the perpetrator has yet
to come forward.

29
00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could it have been the work of a human?

30
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Indeed.

31
00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was he who killed one of us.

32
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The boy who found the dead human.

33
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi Shinichi.

34
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He most likely snapped when
he saw that his friend was murdered.

35
00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:50.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Friend"?

36
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Snapped"?

37
00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is his brain entirely human?

38
00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

39
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His brain remains intact

40
00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and he is coexisting with his parasite.

41
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could say
that he is a valuable sample.

42
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A sample, huh?

43
00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He sounds like he could be a threat.

44
00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am making an effort to secure
a better future for all of us.

45
00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:15.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I ask you to consider my investigation
of him as being a part of that endeavor.

46
00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very well.

47
00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll leave the matter of the boy to you.

48
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, Tamura-san, how is your child?

49
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is living a normal life,

50
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
although I am rearing it
with human assistance.

51
00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh my.

52
00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There.

53
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:37.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the matter?

54
00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've changed your diaper.

55
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There.

56
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's Mommy.

57
00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello. Welcome back.

58
00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quiet.

59
00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have it trained well, don't I?

60
00:04:57.588 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

61
00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you for the help.

62
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please come again tomorrow.

63
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

64
00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I… I'll be going, then!

65
00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>If I were to conduct</i>
<i>an experiment of some kind,</i>

66
00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I would first need to</i>
<i>let it grow a bit more.</i>

67
00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:26.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I investigated for a solid week
but found nothing out of the ordinary.

68
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's of interest that his mother
has gone missing

69
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:33.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that he's a witness
in the high school girl's murder,

70
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he's truly just
an average high school student.

71
00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, that's right.

72
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I understand.

73
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please continue your investigation.

74
00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An "average high school student", huh?

75
00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Human powers of observation
are less than impressive.

76
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, there are some things
only humans are capable of.

77
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could not test him using Shimada Hideo,

78
00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but perhaps I'll try something.

79
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
NISHI FUKUYAMA STATION
SOUTH EXIT

80
00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi Shinichi, right?

81
00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who put you up to this?

82
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A… A woman.

83
00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:40.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A woman?

84
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's her name?

85
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know.
Just met her today for the first time.

86
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the truth!

87
00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yo.

88
00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kamijo.

89
00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why the gloomy face
so early in the morning?

90
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not gloomy.

91
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Things going well with your girlfriend?

92
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What things?

93
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't play dumb.

94
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what I mean.

95
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:15.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cut it out!

96
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing like that's going on.

97
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop joking around.

98
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I don't really want to get into this,

99
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you've heard about Izumi-kun, right?

100
00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

101
00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:31.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I heard he was the first one to find
the victim in the recent murder

102
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and he knew the girl who was killed.

103
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I know.

104
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about it?

105
00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did your brother say something?

106
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really.

107
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just that, even though
something like that happened,

108
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he's so calm.

109
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's acting too normal.

110
00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Morning.

111
00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye, Satomi.

112
00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's up with her?

113
00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:58.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing.

114
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Back when he saved my life,</i>

115
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>he was also so calm and strong.</i>

116
00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It was like he was someone else.</i>

117
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:20.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But was there really nothing</i>
<i>going on between him and Kana?</i>

118
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No, that's not the point.</i>

119
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:29.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Even if nothing was going on,</i>
<i>isn't he being a bit cold about all this?</i>

120
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Murano?

121
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry,
I have to go take care of something.

122
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:35.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

123
00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:43.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it sure was a shock
to see how fast he could move.

124
00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can hardly believe he's human.

125
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And?

126
00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you notice anything else?

127
00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean by that?

128
00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, did anything else seem unnatural?

129
00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was his right hand moving
in a peculiar way, for example?

130
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me think.

131
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Nothing really stood out.

132
00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:08.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>So some other specific change</i>
<i>must have occurred.</i>

133
00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder what's wrong.

134
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:19.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe what happened to Kana
is getting to Murano.

135
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, of course it is.

136
00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'd be weirder if it didn't.

137
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Considering what happened,

138
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm the one who's strange
for being so calm about it.

139
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not normal.

140
00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:34.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you going on about now?

141
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're a perfectly fine human being.

142
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are not like me or my kind.

143
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:44.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hearing you say that makes me lose
even more confidence in myself.

144
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Either way, our conversation
is generating a certain amount of noise.

145
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:51.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you talk out loud on top of that,

146
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:54.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your father will become suspicious
of all the noise.

147
00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad,

148
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going out for a bit.

149
00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't stay out too late.

150
00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't.

151
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Where's he off to at this time of night?</i>

152
00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:30.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If I recall,</i>

153
00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>this is the city</i>
<i>where the girl was murdered.</i>

154
00:10:56.822 --> 00:11:01.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Why would the first one to find the victim</i>
<i>go back to the crime scene?</i>

155
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>There's something going on.</i>

156
00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Given his actions earlier today</i>

157
00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:12.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Izumi Shinichi has a big secret!</i>

158
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, why are we here?

159
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't explain it well,

160
00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think it's true

161
00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I now tend to forget painful
or sad things really quickly.

162
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And is that wrong?

163
00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wasn't like this before.

164
00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I used to obsess over the smallest things
and worry all the time.

165
00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:42.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, that's what
I would call a waste of time.

166
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not what I mean!

167
00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:47.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Who is he talking to?</i>

168
00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Himself?</i>

169
00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Kana approached that monster
because she mistakenly thought it was me

170
00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it got her killed.

171
00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because of me!

172
00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should stop thinking like that.

173
00:12:05.933 --> 00:12:09.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, for her, I want to…

174
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This might be a strange way to put it,

175
00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:15.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I want to mourn her death more.

176
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want to forget
how sad it makes me feel

177
00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:23.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as a human being.

178
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Monster!

179
00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Migi! What are you trying to do?

180
00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:46.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What else? I'm going to kill him!

181
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

182
00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:52.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

183
00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi! Don't interfere!

184
00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

185
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't have sufficient weight
to slice him in half.

186
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not good. If he gets any further away…

187
00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone, help!

188
00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:27.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

190
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

191

192
00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

195
00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:42.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, we can't kill him!

196

199
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:58.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's to protect ourselves, no less.

200
00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:00.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

201
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

202
00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

203
00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:10.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

204
00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:14.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't kill a human being,

205
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:18.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

206
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:21.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He got away.

207
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:01.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
