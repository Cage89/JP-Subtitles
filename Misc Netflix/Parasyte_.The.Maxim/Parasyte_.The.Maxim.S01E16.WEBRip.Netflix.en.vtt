As for the P.I. himself…

4
00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take care of him.

5
00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about the human
with the parasite in his arm?

6
00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Miki's supposed to go tomorrow.

HAPPY FAMILY

10
00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You know what I think?

11
00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Your combat style must be unique.

12
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:25.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why others of my kind
were done in so easily.

13
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's hard to comprehend that

14
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
even with the human brain intact,
you're actually stronger.

15
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Based on our analysis
of the body in our dining area,

16
00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it doesn't seem like victory
was immediate, either.

17
00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I guess it wasn't
the right moment to laugh.

18
00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, how do you usually do it?

19
00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you tell me how you fight?

20
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's with him?

21
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He talks up a storm
and he's creepy as hell.

22
00:02:56.718 --> 00:03:00.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stay on guard.
I'm sure he's trying to get a feel for us.

23
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No matter how expressive he may seem,

24
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
keep in mind that it is totally alien
from human emotions.

25
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

26
00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You always confer while you fight.

27
00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that effective?

28
00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:21.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have excellent speed
and motion detection.

29
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it'll be a bit difficult
to bring your body back intact.

30
00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are too many blades.

31
00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not produce more of your own?

32
00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not that simple.

33
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have to be of a certain size
at minimum.

34
00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's pretty slow.

35
00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You might be faster than him,

36
00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's not as if
you have a lot of stamina.

37
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

38
00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been running all day.

39
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we're in deep trouble.

40
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am also exhausted.
The fight was short but intense.

41
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we're a tired duo.

42
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we've managed to put
some distance between us and him.

43
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's a new type of enemy,
three on one body.

44
00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about his legs?

45
00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His legs?

46
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said during the last fight
that the human part is their weakness.

47
00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we can manage to strike his legs…

48
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Is it not possible?

49
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It bothers me

50
00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I can't get a good sense
of where his parasites are distributed.

51
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not? There are three of them.

52
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to be the head and both arms.

53
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be, but somehow…

54
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We messed up. He's caught up to us.

55
00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He tripped again.

56
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Again"?

57
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Man, you really like to run.

58
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is getting really tiresome.

59
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's just forget about
leaving bodies intact.

60
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't have a choice.
We'll have to gamble.

61
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's aim for the legs, as you suggested.

62
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll block the next attack
that comes from the right.

63
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll have to dodge the attack
coming from the left

64
00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
barehanded while holding your ground.

65
00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're asking the impossible.

66
00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:37.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

67
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impossible.

68
00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I win!

69
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

70
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What was that?
-A mid-air collision.

71
00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Between his own tentacles, no less.

72
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

73
00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm getting a clearer picture
of his true nature now.

74
00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
True nature?

75
00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

76
00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was certainly taken aback at first,

77
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it may be more for show
than anything else.

78
00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope so.

79
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First, the parasites encompass an area
greater than his head and two arms.

80
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The leg I managed to attack
earlier wasn't human.

81
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way!

82
00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In any case, I am certain
that the head is still the control center.

83
00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:23.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't sense independent thought
in his arms' movements.

84
00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here he comes.

85
00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't care how many times I have to run!

86
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I found a good location.

87
00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go into those woods!

88
00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His control center leaves
something to be desired.

89
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His bodily movements lack coordination.

90
00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why he trips
and lets his tentacles collide in mid-air.

91
00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Above all,

92
00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
why do you think his head does not
morph and join in the offensive?

93
00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right.

94
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The head has its hands full coordinating
the arms and other parasitic components.

95
00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, if the head were to morph,
he would fall into chaos.

96
00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing to fear.

97
00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the end, there is only one enemy.

98
00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, we'll fight here. Stop.

99
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rather than aiming for the legs
or torso, go for the head.

100
00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Decapitation is the most certain strategy.

101
00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But how do we…

102
00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can do it!

103
00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At my signal, make a beeline for him
at top speed!

104
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Trust me.

105
00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I finally caught up with you guys.

106
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I never really acted out.

220
00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:56.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Their bodies are still

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:42.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Kuramori-san, let's avenge their deaths!

239
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yes!

240
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ever since I was a little boy,

241
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had a deep admiration
for great detectives,

242
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like Sherlock Holmes,

243
00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:08.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

244
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I managed to become
a private investigator, but…

245
00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:16.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, listen.

246
00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:20.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can still become a great detective.

247
00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:25.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will I be able to avenge them?

248
00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course!

249
00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I… I have some information.

250
00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:36.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But my thoughts are all jumbled together.

251
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can I get something to write with
and somewhere I can calm down?

252
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

253
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:47.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, this isn't telepathy.

254
00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

255
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:52.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's our 16th time meeting in your dreams,

256
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:54.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
though you'll forget all about it again.

257
00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:59.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But you look nothing</i>

258
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You say the same thing every time.

259
00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:06.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't look anything like
the Shinichi I know in reality, either.

260
00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What? Leaving already?</i>

261
00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:15.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have learned that there is no way for me
to communicate with the 30%

262
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of my cells that have
dissipated into your body.

263
00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is no further point in our
meeting like this in your dreams.

264
00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:28.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, we really don't have
much time to lose back in reality.

265
00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>We don't?</i>

266
00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:32.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll remember once you wake up.

267
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

268
00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:38.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What was I about to say?

269
00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:47.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Failure on both fronts?

270
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Inconceivable!

271
00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:54.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was failure on my part to let
you handle dealing with the P.I.

272
00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:57.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Killing his family without killing him?

273
00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are ignorant of human nature.

274
00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:02.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The room was dark.

275
00:18:02.372 --> 00:18:05.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't we just need to kill him next?

276
00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:12.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You all underestimate humans.

277
00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:18.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Individually, they may appear weak,
but that is not the case.

278
00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:22.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What we need to recognize

279
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:28.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that humans are a single lifeform
comprised of millions of individuals.

280
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Besides their individual brains,

281
00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:34.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
humans possess a different "brain"
of enormous magnitude.

282
00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:37.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The moment we act
in opposition to that brain,

283
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we will lose.

284
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:40.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

285
00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

286
00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:46.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something is different.

287
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

292
00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:02.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

293
00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:04.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

294
00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:05.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

295
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
