A dog, huh?

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose it's partially due to
its maturation environment,

4
00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it was negligent with its studies.

Hey, hey. Are you a college student?

8
00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Oh, you're not? An office worker?

9
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seriously?

10
00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:00.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

11
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're super hot.

12
00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:04.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

13
00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, wait a second.
What's wrong with a little fun?

14
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, come have fun with us.
Just for a bit.

15
00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, yeah?

16
00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:12.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa!

17
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll walk you home.

18
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got some guts to do that to us!

19
00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:48.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think my stomach
can hold four at once.

20
00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Four?

21
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I overdid it and took two swings.

22
00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose I should change
my face just to be safe.

23
00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't feel the need
to go to the police anymore?

24
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

25
00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Without you, I'd be an easy kill

26
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for those creepy parasitic creatures.

27
00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A wise decision.

28
00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, I want to have a name to call you.

29
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't.

30
00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:33.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am neither a human being nor a pet.

31
00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:38.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I can't just keep calling you
"you" or "him".

32
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then call me Migi.

33
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? "Migi"?

34
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

35
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I grew by eating your right hand,

36
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
hence "Migi".

37
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can be pretty simple-minded sometimes.

38
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I simply lack interest
in the concept of names.

39
00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice shot!

40
00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun's not bad!

41
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

42
00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess.

43
00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun!

44
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Satomi says she'll forgive you

45
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for what you did if you sink another shot!

46
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Yuko!

48
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
NAGAI

49
00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Five more seconds!

50
00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Here goes nothing!</i>

51
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Yeah!

52
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Migi.

53
00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was amazing, huh, Satomi?

54
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

55
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn Izumi.

56
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I'll go on ahead.

57
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry!

58
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wasn't trying to touch you when I did.

59
00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My right hand just moved andâ€¦

60
00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really sorry!

61
00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you truly sorry?

62
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am!

63
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I seriously am!

64
00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I can forgive you if you'll treat me
to some pancakes next Sunday.

65
00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you do it again, though, you're toast.

66
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll never do it again! I promise!

67
00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:48.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

68
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a promise, then.

69
00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nothing!

72
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are Izumi Shinichi-kun, right?

73
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I am.

75
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77
00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

78
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wanted to mate with
that female, didn't you?

79
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

80
00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mate?

81
00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:35.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not like that!

82
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Come with me.

84
00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So, were you talking to yourself
to practice pick-up lines? Huh?

85
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really.

86
00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have to change out of my gym clothes.

93
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

95
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't fight back?

225
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:37.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

239
00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Relocation should not be possible

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

complex head is not possible.

00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:17.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But from an arm to an arm? Easy.

245
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

248
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, come over and become my right arm!

249
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

251
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:48.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hurry up and kill that human

252
00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:50.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

253
00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:55.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

254
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we should be able to live
for at least 140 years.

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:09.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you won't have a choice
once I cut off that human's head.

260
00:16:21.438 --> 00:16:24.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

261

266
00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:47.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was simply uncertain as to

267
00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:50.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
