Izumi-kun, your eyes,

2
00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they're so empty.

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

THE SELFISH GENE

6
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Shinichi, you had me worried back there.

7
00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was just as well.

8
00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If that man had been watching us again,

9
00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he'd start treating Murano
like a monster, too.

10
00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:00.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That man?

11
00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, the man we ran into before.

12
00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was watching me this afternoon.

13
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why didn't you say so sooner?
-You would've tried to kill him if I had.

14
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have shifted my thinking.

15
00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is continuing his investigation
of you, isn't he?

16
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the same individual
is continuing the operation

17
00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
despite his cover being blown,

18
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it may mean that the enemy
is surprisingly small in number.

19
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We might as well track down everyone
involved in their investigation and--

20
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:29.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kill all of them?

21
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

22
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have come to realize just how much you
reject the notion of killing other humans.

23
00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We must work together.

24
00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:42.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, right.

25
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we should table killing for now
and just investigate him.

26
00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How?

27
00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll call an ally and enlist their help.

28
00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An ally, huh?

29
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where can we find an ally
in the whole wide world…

30
00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Thank you for coming all the way here.

31
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry to get you involved in all this.

32
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No need to apologize!

33
00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're the only one I know
who's in the same boat as me!

34
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have to help each other!

35
00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you've already helped me before.

36
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, no shit.

37
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't ask for any of this!

38
00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That wasn't me.

39
00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

40
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

41
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you should just off that guy already.

42
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not that easy, okay?

43
00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, do you have any leads
on who's behind all this?

44
00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, kind of.

45
00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Assuming the enemy
is not an organized entity,

46
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we do have an idea.

47
00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:46.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, supposing we just catch
the guy instead of offing him,

48
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope you at least know his face.

49
00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I remember it well.

50
00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He looks like this.

51
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, got it.

52
00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For now, I'll stay in the business hotel
by the train station.

53
00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

54
00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, by the way.

55
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
About his name. We decided
"Parasite" was too confusing

56
00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:09.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they use that term
on TV and on the web,

57
00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so we're calling him Joe now.

58
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Joe" for "jaw"?

59
00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

60
00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:17.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who gives a shit about names?

61
00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

62
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Names are unimportant.

63
00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You look exhausted.

64
00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
INVESTIGATION REPORT

65
00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should go see a doctor.

66
00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did go to a doctor, see?

67
00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not what I meant.

68
00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course you don't believe me.

69
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A right hand stretching out
and attacking me?

70
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I actually did get hurt.

71
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is real, isn't it? Isn't it?

72
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please calm down.

73
00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I may not look it,
but I've calmed down quite a bit.

74
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I've thought long and hard
about what's happened.

75
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About what that thing was.

76
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I haven't been able to find
an answer that makes any sense.

77
00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll pay you for your work
up to this point,

78
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but let's stop here.

79
00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop?

80
00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When we're right in the thick of things?

81
00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what about me?

82
00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about everything
going through my mind?

83
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still haven't figured out
what that thing was!

84
00:05:24.782 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Asking me to believe your story
is far more unreasonable.

85
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well…

86
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I know!

87
00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said something

88
00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
about Izumi Shinichi's
right hand before, didn't you?

89
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:37.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did I?

90
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did! You definitely did!

91
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see it now! You knew it, too!

92
00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right!

93
00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the real reason
you asked me to investigate him!

94
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

95
00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, tell me the truth!

96
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please stop this.

97
00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Wait!

98
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's the female teacher who vanished
from his high school, Tamiya Ryouko.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't expect her

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:54.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
She even wants to meet
on the roof of a university building.

235
00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
What's she trying to pull?

236
00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:04.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We are currently 130 meters away

237
00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She must be somewhere
behind that building.

238
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:09.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't tell me she's now
a university lecturer

239
00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
after her stint as a high school teacher.

240
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:16.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
"Altruism" is behavior undertaken
for the benefit of another.

241
00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:18.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is the opposite of "selfishness".

242
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At first glance, altruistic behavior
poses no advantage for the self.

243
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:24.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rather, it is behavior
that helps others despite posing

244
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a distinct disadvantage to the self.

245
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is perhaps not so rare…
-It's a baby!

246
00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:29.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-…among human beings,
-So cute.

247
00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:33.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
…but altruistic behavior
has also been observed

248
00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
among a number of animal species.

249
00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:40.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For example, honeybees
will sacrifice themselves

250
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to protect the hive when predators appear.

251
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:47.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This behavior may be instinctive.

252
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, there exists
a prime example of behavior

253
00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:53.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that does not serve
to protect one's own species.

254
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Infanticide.

255
00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:59.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do animals kill offspring
of their own species?

256
00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:05.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The prevailing theory in recent years
is the "selfish gene".

257
00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:10.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In a nutshell, the body of an animal
is merely its DNA's puppet.

258
00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:12.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What matters is not its species but itself

259
00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:16.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and its own offspring
who will inherit its DNA.

260
00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:18.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we apply this theory more broadly,

261
00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it can explain a wide variety
of altruistic behavior,

262
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
such as caring for others in a herd,

263
00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
familial love, marital love,

264
00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:29.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and even maternal love.

265
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This would mean that there is
no such thing as compassion or love.

266
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:36.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All behavior that appears
to stem from love is,

267
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:41.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in fact, merely behavior to better
the transmission of an individual's DNA.

268
00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:44.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, this theory
is not without its problems.

269
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:49.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are multiple cases observed
in nature where animals help others

270
00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:52.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who will have no impact
on the transmission of their own DNA

271
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and even others who are
of an entirely different species.

272
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In addition,

273
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's uncertain whether complex
human thought

274
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
can be captured in full by this theory.

275
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>In that sense,</i>

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>it may be interesting to consider</i>
<i>whether human efforts in the realm</i>

<i>are altruistic or selfish in nature.</i>

279
00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:16.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It's almost time.</i>

280
00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who holds their baby like that?
-I don't know.

281
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm glad you came.

282
00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You look well.

283
00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:34.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why here?

284
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I chose this location

285
00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:40.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because others of my kind
are rarely present.

286
00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:43.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was also a lecture here
I wanted to attend.

287
00:16:44.753 --> 00:16:45.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see it's true.

288
00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are very different from before.

289
00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:50.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did you two mix?

290
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened?

291
00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:54.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I find it difficult to believe
it happened on its own.

292
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that baby yours?

293
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:01.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it is.

294
00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:04.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't done anything to it yet.

295
00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:06.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Done anything?

296
00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:08.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your right hand.

297
00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:11.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Migi", was it?
Why don't we exchange information again?

298
00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:13.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'll benefit us both.

299
00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:15.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd first like to confirm

300
00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that it was you who hired
the private investigator.

301
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:19.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did it not occur to you

302
00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that doing so entailed
a certain amount of risk to yourself?

303
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can handle myself.

304
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can just assume
another identity if necessary.

305
00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:31.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know about the mayor,
Hirokawa, don't you?

306
00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:33.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you all planning,
making a monster into a mayor?

307
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know much about it, either,

308
00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:39.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but we are evolving as a species.

309
00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:41.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have realized that just going around

310
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
killing and eating humans
is not safe for us.

311
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:50.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to consider how to coexist
with humans from now on.

312
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coexist, huh?

313
00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shimada Hideo said the same thing,
but in the end…

314
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For example,

315
00:17:56.283 --> 00:17:59.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
can't it be said that, in a certain sense,
humans and livestock coexist?

316
00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:02.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, they are not equal.

317
00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:07.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From a pig's perspective, humans
are merely monsters who feed upon them.

318
00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:11.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See, it is the human species who are
making grandiose statements like,

319
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:15.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"All life on Earth must coexist."

320
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:19.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There may be some truth
to what you're saying,

321
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I…

322
00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have reasons why I absolutely
