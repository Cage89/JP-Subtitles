<i>It's the way you look.</i>

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I can't stand the way you look.</i>

3
00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:14.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>You look so…</i>

4
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Calm down, Shinichi.

5
00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're in trouble if you're short of breath
when we have to fight.

6
00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

7
00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have liked to have discussed
many things with you both,

8
00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I have a bad feeling about this,

9
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I won't drag this out.

10
00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've killed 38 so far.

11
00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mainly as food,

12
00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I believe my numbers
are on the low end among my kind.

13
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could supplement the lack
with normal food humans eat.

14
00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In other words,

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
parasites can survive
without eating humans.

16
00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have also done much research on humans.

17
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are we parasites to humans,

18
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and what are humans to us?

19
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My conclusion is this.

20
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are two halves of the same whole.

21
00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We and humans are one family.

22
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are the children of the human race.

23
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? What are you talking about?

24
00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cut the crap!

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fine.

26
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I expect this to be difficult for you
to comprehend, given human emotions.

27
00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
However, we are fragile.

28
00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We are merely a life form
that cannot survive on its own.

29
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So don't bully us.

30
00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:41.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Bully"?

31
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look who's talking!

32
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You two are very rare beings.

33
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:52.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is why I wanted you
to know my thoughts.

34
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
While I'm at it, a word of advice.

35
00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:59.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
About Gotou, the man
who recently pursued you,

36
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
don't fight him.

37
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it had been Gotou instead
of Miki from the beginning,

38
00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:09.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you would be dead by now.

39
00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably.

40
00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:17.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is indeed one of our "fragile" kind
that I created through experimentation,

41
00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he is invincible.

42
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're contradicting yourself.

43
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She's laughing!</i>

44
00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:36.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And regarding the other one,
the mayor, Hirokawa…

63

65

66
00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:24.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll ask someone else.

67
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

68
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

69
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

70
00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:35.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

121
00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been thinking for a long while.

122
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:04.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For what purpose
was I born into this world?

123
00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:11.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whenever I resolved one question,
another would arise in its place.

124
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I sought the beginning.

125
00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I sought the end.

126
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:22.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've just been walking and walking,

127
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps nothing will change,

128
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:29.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I'm to stop my journey,
that is fine, too.

129
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:33.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if I were informed that

130
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd just accept it.

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

132
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I found an answer to yet

134
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the end, I didn't do anything to it.

135
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:55.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

136
00:09:55.886 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Raise the child by human hands,

137
00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

138
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry.

139
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

140
00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

141
00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I recently imitated a human,
laughing out loud in front of a mirror.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:20.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:59.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

196
00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:04.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right that he's unusually poised

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:17.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:20.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:22.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:30.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

225
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:53.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the last thing we'll ask of you.

226
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:54.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Okay, wait in this room.

230
00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:05.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When they call your name,

231
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:06.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

232

00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:18.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

234
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:21.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone with the same ability as you.

235
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said you'd know if you met one, right?

236
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Yeah, that's right! I can tell!</i>

237
00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:29.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, anyway.

238
00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:32.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Second, let us know</i>

239
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

240
00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're saying one of those monsters
is a suspect here?

241
00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:38.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't tell me they're just going to
troop in here all meek-like! Hey!

242
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this glass going to keep me safe?

243
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:43.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd rather be hung
than be eaten by those monsters!

244
00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:44.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine!

245
00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:46.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry.

246
00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:48.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's thick bullet-proof glass.

247
00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And soundproof to boot.

248
00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Let's begin.</i>

249
00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:55.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Fukami-san, please enter.</i>

250
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:57.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

251
00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:07.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hey, Uragami.</i>

252
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Look at him!</i>

253
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine, fine.

254
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think, Fukami-san?

255
00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:18.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, he is not a parasite.

256
00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:23.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is responding slightly to my telepathy.

257
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's walled his mind off,

258
00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:30.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I doubt he has the same ability as me.

259
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:34.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's talking up a good game.

260
00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:37.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should explain beforehand

261
00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:40.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that these self-proclaimed
"psychics" in the room

262
00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are probably all frauds.

263
00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:45.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even if anyone had this superpo-- rather,

264
00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:49.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this highly honed ability at all,
it'd probably just be him.

265
00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:52.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Uragami?

266
00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:54.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A total fraud.

267
00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell this dweeb I said,

268
00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:58.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Show me a liar
and I will show you a thief."

269
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look who's talking!

270
00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:03.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he's a serial killer.

271
00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next one, please.

272
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What's wrong, Uragami?</i>

273
00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:13.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're cruel, Detective.

274
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:15.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know the kind of life
we lead in prison.

275
00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:19.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could you put such a hottie
in front of me?

276
00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he actually…

277
00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should probably stop him.

278
00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His focus may drop.

279
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no mistake!

280
00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:34.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This man's a parasite!

281
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:38.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

282
00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:41.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a joke.

283
00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:46.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Izumi-kun, thank you for waiting.</i>
<i>Please go in.</i>

284
00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:47.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

285
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:52.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't hear each other,
so there's no need to hold back.

286
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

287
00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:57.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

288
00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:59.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure.

289
00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:03.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You seem to run into parasites
often for some reason.

290
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:07.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This time, the parasite named
Tamura Reiko approached you.

291
00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps you have something
that attracts them.

292
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:15.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or perhaps you have
an ability to tell them apart?

293
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

295
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:20.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

296
00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:27.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
