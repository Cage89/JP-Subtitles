00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

132
00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:24.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm counting on you to ID the monsters.

134
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it justifiable self-defense,

135
00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:38.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

140
00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:04.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should be able to get through
the cordon easily enough.

141
00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

142
00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:14.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I intend to watch how the enemy
fights for a while longer first.

143
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:19.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

154
00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

155
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

158
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you'll accompany the joint team
formed by the Mutsuki and Satsuki Squads.

159
00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

160
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:16.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

161
00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:19.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

be able to ID the enemy.

162
00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:47.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

167
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

172
00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:23.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

199
00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:37.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:07.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
