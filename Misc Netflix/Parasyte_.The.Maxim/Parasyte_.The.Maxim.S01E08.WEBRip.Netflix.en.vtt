00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:41.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a joint session
between our classes.

220
00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:47.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>If I went all-out, I'd set a world record.</i>

221
00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ten point eight seconds?

222
00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:01.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's unusual to transfer schools
at this time of year.

223
00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, he said he had to move
because of his dad's job.

224
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:05.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm jealous.

225
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:08.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wish I was in the same class as Hide.

226
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Hide"?

227
00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:11.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hide for Shimada Hideo.

228
00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:14.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you liked Izumi-kun.

229
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Like you don't.

230
00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Quit teasing me.

231
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:23.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Izumi-kun's with Satomi, right?

232
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

233
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, um…

234
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sports are very good.

235
00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:37.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The more you play, the better
you become at using your body.

236
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:39.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Why drag this out?

237
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Are you planning to kill me
once I let my guard down?

238
00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:44.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You misunderstand me.

239
00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:46.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that what your right hand thinks
as well?

240
00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:52.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Didn't Tamiya Ryoko send you
to get rid of me?

241
00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamiya Ryoko?

242
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:58.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, she has a different name now.

243
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But yes, she's the one
who told me about you.

244
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:03.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not what this is about, though.

245
00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:05.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no intention

246

of harming you or anyone around you
at this school for that matter.

247
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I haven't harmed
any humans in recent memory.

248
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I subsist on a diet
similar to that of humans.

249
00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If parasites learned to exist
without killing humans,

250
00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:24.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there'd be no problem, right?

251
00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You expect me to believe you?

252
00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:29.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're starting to look for a way

253
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:33.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to coexist with humans in human society.

254
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We wanted the two of you
to think about that,

255
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
given that you're somewhere
between humanity and our kind.

256
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Interesting.

257
00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:45.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The things you say
always manage to pique my interest.

258
00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't they?

259
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:49.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, I am only inclined
to believe half of what you're saying.

260
00:15:50.407 --> 00:15:51.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

261
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I don't desire conflict, either.

262
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's call it a day.

263
00:15:56.997 --> 00:15:58.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go, Shinichi.

264
00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:00.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Why now?

265
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:09.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

266
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We weren't even done talking.

267
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, I'm going to sleep.

268
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're drowsy again?
-I'll be out for about four hours.

269
00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:20.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he learns of this weakness,
who knows what he will do?

270

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:57.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I don't know why I got it wrong

334
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's not like I was totally off

340
00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:42.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
