I'm sorry to sour the mood, Shinichi, butâ€¦

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. You must be kidding.

3
00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to start running right now.

4
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure it's him?

5
00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These wavelengths are too powerful
to come from some lackey.

6
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And given the speed of his approach,
I'd say he's in a car.

7
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take a right at that corner.

8
00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit! Now I'm a thief.

9
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this the time to whine about it?

10
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When did you learn to drive, anyway?

11
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mastered Japanese

Migi, I have a favor to ask.

13
00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please go somewhere
with as few people as possible.

14
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we fight him in a city,
many people will die.

15
00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very well.

16
00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I've thought of something
that's worth a gamble.

QUIESCENCE AND AWAKENING

19
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well?

20
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't work.

21
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's alive.

22
00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's tough.

23
00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go.

24
00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:58.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

25
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

26
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, stop.

27
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are we stopping?

28
00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't afford to waste time here!

29
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Calm down.

30
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's strategize until he shows up.

31
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strategize?

32
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We might be minutes away
from being chopped up!

33
00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

34
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I understand how you feel.

35
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyone would fear death.

36
00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm afraid as well.

37
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
However, this is our moment of truth!

38
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have a strength
normal humans don't have.

39
00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can be calm,
no matter what the circumstance.

40
00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, put your hand on your chest

41
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and breathe deeply like you always do.

42
00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good. Well done.

43
00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen.

44
00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:08.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When it comes to ability,
Gotou surpasses us in every way.

45
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By simple calculations,
our odds of victory might be 0%,

46
00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that just means we should
approach this from a different angle.

47
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we can't win even by working together,

48
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
maybe we should try not working together.

49
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

50
00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In war, what matters
is opportunity, not numbers.

51
00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Opportunity?

52
00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:33.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In your pocket is a lighter
I found in the car.

53
00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're above.

54
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've spread out among
the tree branches to hide.

55
00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How unoriginal.

64
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:09.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
