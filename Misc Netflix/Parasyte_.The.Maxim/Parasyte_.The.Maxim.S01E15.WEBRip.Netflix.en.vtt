00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've just parted ways.

2
00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which one should I follow?

3
00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, got it.

4
00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll follow the man.

5
00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Picking up a woman, huh?

6
00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, man.

7
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so dense that I didn't even notice.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES

10
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need your help.

11
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The last thing
he said was that he was going

12
00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
into the basement of this building.

13
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:32.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I lacked the courage
to go down there myself--

14
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why we told you
that you're in way over your head!

15
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well?

16
00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you sense anything?

17
00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

18
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
None of my kind is nearby.

19
00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no one here.

20
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something smells awful.

21
00:03:58.863 --> 00:03:59.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

22
00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It can't be.</i>

23
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No way.</i>

24
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, one incoming!

25
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two hundred meters.
Hundred and eighty meters.

26
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fast.

27
00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's probably in a car.

28
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we go out now, we'll come
face to face by the entrance.

29
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crap!

30
00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got to hide!

31
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's brought lunch.

32
00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yuck. What is this place?

33
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind that.

34
00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:33.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just stand over there, will you?

35
00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like this?

36
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that's great.

37
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's this about? You're kind of weird.

38
00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't go out there, Shinichi.

39
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Why is it hiding there?</i>

40
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

41
00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So…

42
00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>The moment of truth when they eat humans.</i>

43
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

44
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

45
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not one of us?

46
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Watch out!

47
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's not human! Get away from him!

48
00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurry!

49
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Run, now!

50
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:32.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why, you!

51
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Humans!

52
00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen, Shinichi.

53
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forget that I'm here.

54
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:43.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we take the time to discuss
strategy and whatnot, we'll lose.

55
00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see his blades' movements, right?

56
00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah!

57
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's incredible. They're so fast!

58
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just keep dodging his attacks.

59
00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't try to defeat him
barehanded like you did before!

60
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that'll be enough to win?

61
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good. Your moves aren't bad.

62
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'll win
by having the better mount.

63
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who are you calling a "mount"?

64
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My kind's weakness lies below the neck.
The human portion.

65
00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll eventually win, as long as
we keep that part protected.

66
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I couldn't save her.

67
00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is nothing new, though.

68
00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew what was going on.

69
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew

70
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and yet I did nothing for so long.

71
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In any case, we've got trouble.

72
00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Given the male's attitude,

73
00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this must be one of the dining areas
coordinated by Hirokawa's group.

74
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means our actions constitute
an act of war against them.

75
00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you listening, Shinichi?

76
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was wrong.

77
00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

78
00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was wrong to…

79
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:15.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, we need to get clear
of this place as soon as possible.

80
00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kuramori-san, you're not
going to stop now, are you?

81
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a detective I've met before.

82
00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think his name is Hirama.

83
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

84
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He even suspected me
of being one of the monsters.

85
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, don't get any strange ideas.

86
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's so strange about it?

87
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're about to fight Hirokawa's group.

88
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you hear yourself?

89
00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:56.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We may be in an extremely
precarious situation right now.

90
00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll use the footage Kuramori-san
recorded as evidence

91
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to get the police to search
the building from top to bottom.

92
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be ridiculous.

93
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're in that footage, too.

94
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't stand this anymore!

95
00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:12.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want your father to be killed, too?

96
00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

97
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:16.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean by that?

98
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry.

99
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was wrong.

100
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like you all said, I'm in over my head.

101
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:26.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a small-timer.

102
00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:29.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I shouldn't have gotten
involved in all this.

103
00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll destroy all the evidence
I've gathered so far.

104
00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:38.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But why?

105
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You saw what happened!

106
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't that mean anything to you?

107
00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course it did!

108
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My teeth are still chattering!

109
00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:50.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyone who saw that and still thinks
they can fight them is crazy!

110
00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're no longer a normal human being!

111
00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even that fight,

112
00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it was basically two monsters
trying to kill each other.

113
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just a weak human being.

114
00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:09.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have neither the strength
nor the courage to protect myself.

115
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not you, okay?

116
00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From this day on,

117
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to forget about
monsters, Tamura Reiko, and you.

118
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't look at me like that.

119
00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:25.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have a wife and child.

120
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:28.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know I made a grandiose speech

121
00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
about the good of humanity
and all that to you before.

122
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:35.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well…

124
00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a normal human being for you.

125
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up.

126
00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>You're no longer a normal human being!</i>

127
00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He's right.</i>

128
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

129
00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What can I do?</i>

130
00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What can I do?</i>

131
00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

132
00:11:03.704 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've said this to you many times already,
but let's not engage in futile resistance.

133
00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Futile?

134
00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not so sure.

135
00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:13.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were able to win today.

136
00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:18.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right! We can win
if it's one-on-one!

137
00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:22.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With my cooperation, you mean.

138
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Yes, I can do this.</i>

139
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I can do anything if I put my mind to it!</i>

140
00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Looking back.</i>

141
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>One by one.</i>

142
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Right, I can get them one by one!</i>

143
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I won't ask for help from any other human.</i>

144
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I'll do this alone.</i>

145
00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Migi would help me for sure, then.</i>

146
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No, I will make him help me!</i>

147
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:08.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Call it human ego or whatever you want,</i>

148
00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but I just want to save</i>
<i>as many people as I can!</i>

149
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>That would mean</i>
<i>a safer world for Murano, too.</i>

150
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Satomi, did you have a fight
with Izumi-kun or something?

151
00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:24.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think I've seen
you two together lately.

152
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It wasn't really a fight, but I guess
we just can't trust each other.

153
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He doesn't look like he can't trust you.

154
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't get him at all!

155
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, Satomi!

156
00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I will protect as many people as I can!</i>

157
00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:05.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The enemy is formidable.

158
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We must deal with him.

159
00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:09.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Killing him would be a waste,

160
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
although I couldn't care less
about the P.I.

161
00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:13.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nonsense.

162
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is, without a doubt, a dangerous foe.

163
00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would you defend him?

164
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are not human.

165
00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:23.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are our opinions so incompatible?

166
00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:25.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamura-san,

167
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:28.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've heard that you are
rearing a human child.

168
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:30.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that affecting your judgment?

169
00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:33.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it time to dispose of it?

170
00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't do that just yet.

171
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:43.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In any event, Izumi Shinichi killed
one of us in our dining area.

172
00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:45.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We clearly cannot let this go.

173
00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should eliminate him.

174
00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:49.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I suppose it's unavoidable.

175
00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:54.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, I would like his body
to be brought back intact.

176
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

177
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would like to dissect him.

178
00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was impressive, Gotou-san.

179
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was it Mozart?

180
00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:26.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chopin.

181
00:14:27.324 --> 00:14:30.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our target is said to be
a formidable match.

182
00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:34.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do think it should be you
who handles him, but…

183
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:40.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If Miki wants to do it, I'll let him.

184
00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:44.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He just needs more experience.

185
00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:52.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What is this?</i>

186
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:54.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Who are you?</i>

187
00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got my hands full.

188
00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

189
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that's how I appear to you.

190
00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But look who's talking.

191
00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:17.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

192
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a nightmare.

193
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

196

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

198
00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be late to class.

199
00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No time for that. My kind, incoming.

200
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

201

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's fight.

203
00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

204
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be so eager.

205
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're the target.

206
00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're coming straight for us
with the intent to kill us.

207
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there are three.

208
00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three?

209
00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:19.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fight or flee?

210
00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You seem to be spoiling for a fight.

211
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If so, this is the ideal location for it.

212
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't do this at the school!

214
00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:36.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

215
00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:39.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

216
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay. You'll be safe.

217

Huh?

218
00:16:45.212 --> 00:16:46.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay!

219
00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:49.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll be safe now.

220
00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:57.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

223
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop! I've lost them.

224
00:17:01.603 --> 00:17:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've put more than 300 meters

225
00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:05.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It seems they are on foot.

226
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three coming for us at once?

227
00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:12.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In this scenario,

228
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we should think about
taking them out one by one

229
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and not all three at once.

230
00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:19.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:24.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's give it a try.

232
00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:26.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, never mind.

233
00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:28.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forget that strategy.

234
00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

235
00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:31.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sleepy.

236
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be out for four hours.

237
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:34.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why now?

238
00:17:35.637 --> 00:17:37.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't help it.

239
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a physiological phenomenon.

240
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:42.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should just stay on the move.

241
00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:44.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In a straight line when possible.

242
00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:47.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's our only option right now.

243
00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm on my own for four hours?

244
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess I can take a small breather.

245
00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:12.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two more hours.

246
00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:13.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I can manage to shake them off.

247
00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:16.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

248
00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:17.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

249
00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:21.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

252

253
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

254
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No one around and it's quiet.

255

258
00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'd heard that you're a tough one.

259
00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

260
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:54.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
