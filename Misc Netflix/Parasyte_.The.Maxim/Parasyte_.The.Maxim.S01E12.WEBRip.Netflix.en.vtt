00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
There's certainly a wide variety
of types, isn't there?

4
00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Tamiya Ryoko, the teacher,
was already a surprise,

5
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but now we have a politician.

6
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:05.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can't possibly get elected without
a solid grasp of human psychology.

7
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He won't get elected.

8
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He'll show his true colors soon enough.

9
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. Given the town he's in,

10
00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamiya Ryoko may be involved, too.

11
00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then is there a connection between…
-<i>You're way too worked up over this.</i>

12
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…him and Shimada Hideo as well?

13
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That would mean--
-What's his goal?

14
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, exactly!

15
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>The first possibility is,</i>
<i>by assuming a human identity</i>

16
00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>and studying mankind,</i>

17
00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>he developed a real interest in politics.</i>

18
00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>If that is the case,</i>
<i>he may actually become a decent mayor.</i>

19
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

20
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The second possibility is,

21
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he wants to secure a safe haven
and food source for parasites.

22
00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have a point.

23
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if they hide the body
after they feed,

24
00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that still results in missing persons.

25
00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they happen to kill a celebrity,
there'd be an uproar.

26
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Attaining a position with access
to information is more advantageous

27
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for preventing such occurrences
and securing a food source.

28
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that's his goal.

29
00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>If they organize,</i>
<i>they'll become even more dangerous.</i>

30
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That'd put her at risk, too.</i>

31
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it is at the municipal level

32
00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that environmental issues…
-Let's go over there.

33
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-…can be addressed in a practical sense.

34
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That wasn't where we agreed to meet up.

35
00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:19.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why were you there?

36
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had a strong feeling
that you were there.

37
00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you not to approach
even if you had that sensation.

38
00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:28.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it wasn't just you.

39
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could sense it from the people
behind you, too.

40
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd say there were four or five of them.

41
00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Migi said there were eight,</i>

42
00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>so her ability to sense parasites</i>
<i>isn't as strong as theirs.</i>

43
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But this places her in too much danger.</i>

44
00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

45
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa!

46
00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you thinking about?

47
00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing!

48
00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's none of your business
what I'm thinking about.

49
00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was just curious.

REGAIN THE FRUITFUL
COEXISTENCE BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE

52
00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From where I stand,

53
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would prefer that you do not
become involved any further.

54
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if we were to fight them,
we would lose.

55
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't come here to fight.

56
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just want to know how many
of them have gathered here.

57
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's impossible to count their numbers.

58
00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An estimate is fine.

59
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Aren't you curious to know
how others of your kind have evolved?

60
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, sure.

61
00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well?

62
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's only when you go looking for them
that you can't find them.

63
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Izumi!

64
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi.

65
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's up?

66
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to ask you something.

67
00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:50.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

68
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About your "superpower".

69
00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you ever felt that sensation
from anyone other than me?

70
00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

71
00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But only sometimes.

73
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I find them, they sometimes
turn out to be a random old dude.

74
00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry to sound like a broken record,

75
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I want you to keep your distance
even if you feel that "signal".

76
00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But why?

77
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it because it's coming
from those "parasites"

78
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that everyone's talking about online?

79
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you a parasite, too?

80
00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I… I didn't…
-Kana.

81
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:26.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mitsuo!

82
00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to talk to Kana.

83
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Later, then.

84
00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:34.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, hang on.

85
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's continue this later.

86
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to have
a serious conversation with you.

87
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:39.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

88
00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll email you.

89
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't need to email.

90
00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can feel you when you're near.

91
00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Feel you"?

92
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you said I'm not the only one
who can make you feel that.

93
00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Who can make you feel that"?

94
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kana, you--

95
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You idiot!

96
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got it completely wrong!

97
00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

98
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is this "serious conversation"
you mentioned earlier?

99
00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:11.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was seeing that female
your real objective today?

100
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what if it was?

101
00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Over time, my kind has evolved.

102
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we will never develop
what humans call "sympathy".

103
00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that.

104
00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I ask that you do not put me at risk.

105
00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you were to tell her too much…

106
00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

111
00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

113
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what I just said.

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:03.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:41.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your email said a place without
many people around would be best.

124
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

125
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

while trying to take over my head

129
00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So he will never attack anyone.

130
00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, everything makes sense, right?

131
00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was hoping for something
more interesting.

132
00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

135
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:26.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's true, give me proof.

136

Show me how your right hand

137
00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like I said, he's sleeping right now.

138
00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just come out and say it.

139
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just don't want to see me anymore

00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:40.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you don't want that girl,
Satomi or whatever, to get the wrong idea.

141
00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not it.

142
00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't tell you such an elaborate lie
just for something like that.

143
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

146
00:08:57.119 --> 00:09:02.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the ability to tell you apart

147
00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

148
00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

149
00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can tell you apart, specifically,
from the rest of those monsters.

150
00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

151
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:16.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Well, I guess…

153
00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:26.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm the only one in the whole world

155
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure it's amazing.

156

157
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want you to show me

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

159
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:46.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Otherwise, I don't think
I can ever really believe your story.

161
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

202
00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:14.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:32.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

209
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:37.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a signal parasites emit that
lets us sense each other's location.

She probably only emits the signal

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:17.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
