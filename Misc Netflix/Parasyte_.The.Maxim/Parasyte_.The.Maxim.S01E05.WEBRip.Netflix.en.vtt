28
00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:20.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You slept in
because your body wanted more sleep.

29
00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sleep is beneficial.

30
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

31

Although it's minimal,
you're no longer pure.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is linked to your brain
through your nerves and bodily fluids.

36
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That may be the reason.

37
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I mean is that your brain
may be undergoing changes, as well.

something "inhuman" about you.

41
00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You should be wary of that woman.

219
00:14:57.062 --> 00:15:00.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it appears she has the ability to sense

220

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:05.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

222
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is on another level entirely.

224
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should stay as far away
from her as you can.

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:15.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:41.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

231
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
