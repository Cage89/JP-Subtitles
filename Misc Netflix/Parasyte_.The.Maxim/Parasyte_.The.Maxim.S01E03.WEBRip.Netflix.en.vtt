You don't seem to be making any progress.

109
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

110
00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh… Well…

111
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

112
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bow!

113
00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Izumi-kun, come to
the guidance office later, would you?

114
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right?

115
00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, did you do something?
-No.

116
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm jealous!

117
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd love to get a personal lesson
from a babe like her.

118
00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, there's a babe right here.

119
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, Izumi-kun?

120
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nah, you've got nothing
on Tamiya-sensei's mature beauty.

121
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I guess she prefers guys like Izumi.

122
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who'd have thought.

123
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have a clue!

125
00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're the one without a clue.

127
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

128
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:59.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's approximately ten meters away.

129
00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're awake now?

130
00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
GUIDANCE OFFICE

131
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

132
00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come in, please.

133
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:17.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Izumi Shinichi-kun,
I believe you know what I am.

134
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

135
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Yeah"?

136
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's no way to speak
to your teacher, is it?

137
00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no need to be so tense.

138
00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your right hand should know that
I have no intention of killing you.

139
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, if we were to fight
in such close quarters,

140
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we would both end up mortally wounded.

141
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would like to talk some more with you.

142
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you make time to meet
after school today?

143
00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

144
00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:50.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if it's a trap?

145
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want nothing to do with this!

146
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:56.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are humans so irrational?

147
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

148
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I wanted to kill you,
I already would have.

149
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:05.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

150
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am curious about you.

151
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are the first case
of this nature I have come across.

152
00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I want more data.

153
00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:16.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd like to exchange information

154
00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:19.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and discuss the future with you.

155
00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:21.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The future?

156
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that's all I wanted to say.

157
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamiya-sensei.

158
00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes?

159
00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you have any plans today?

160
00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I am counseling some students.

161
00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:40.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

162
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

163
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, come with me to the bookstore.

164
00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:50.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

165
00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:52.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, that's…

166
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, roll up your sleeves.

167
00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:15.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

168
00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not like we're going to fight.

169
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Because there are two people coming.
-Huh?

170
00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:22.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or should I say, two of my kind?

171
00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it was a trap?

172
00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't know that yet.

173
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More importantly, Shinichi,

174
00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
slow down your heartbeat some, will you?

175
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're making me anxious.

176
00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Easy for you to say!

177
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for the wait.

178
00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:48.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Allow me to introduce you to A-san.

179
00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"A-san"?

180
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He doesn't have a name.

181
00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who the hell is he?

182
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:57.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How can we consider him one of us?

183
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop it.

184
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:04.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is no advantage in trying
to kill each other here.

185
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

186
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:12.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you have only met
those two types so far.

187
00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

188
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Izumi-kun.

189
00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:18.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think we are?

190
00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:21.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Man-eating monsters.

191
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:23.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What else should I think?

192
00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:29.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you see,
A-san and I tried having sex.

193
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:32.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry!

194
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me!

195
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:39.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think happened as a result?

196
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. I became pregnant.

197
00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:45.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, here's a question for you.

198
00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:51.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The "thing" that's growing inside me now,
what do you think it is?

199
00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:53.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well…

200
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:56.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A normal human being, no?

201
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

202
00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:02.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, an ordinary human baby.

203
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then, what does that make us?

204
00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

205
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what I'd like to ask, too.

206
00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You eat other humans in order
to keep your human host alive.

207
00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's like cannibalism.

208
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would you do something like that?

209
00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:21.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you try asking that
to your right hand?

210
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:26.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I receive nutrients directly
through Shinichi's blood.

211
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I consequently do not experience hunger

212
00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
nor do I know the reasons for cannibalism.

213
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have no reproductive capabilities

214
00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:36.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and endlessly engage in
quasi-cannibalistic activities.

215
00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do such life forms exist anywhere else?

216
00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought that strange as well.

217
00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you count as a life form or not?

218
00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Either way,

219
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I find it difficult to believe
you're of this world.

220
00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:50.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm leaving.

221
00:12:50.644 --> 00:12:54.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Knowing what I am
will not change anything.

222
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will eat when I feel hungry

223
00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I will eliminate any
who stands in my way.

224
00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:00.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's all there is.

225
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He is dangerous.</i>

226
00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He should be eliminated.</i>

227
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:12.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps it's a difference
in our maturation environments.

228
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So…

229
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:19.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Humans can take
illogical actions at times,

230
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I feel I should give you a warning.

231
00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:25.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Supposing you choose to see me
as an enemy and cause a scene,

232
00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:28.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you are at a greater disadvantage
since you cannot change your face.

233
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I prefer to safeguard
my current "human" identity as well,

234
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I do not intend to do anything extreme.

235
00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:41.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, if I so choose, I can
take on an entire classroom…

236
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and massacre everyone in three seconds.

237
00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:52.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have friends in my class, do you not?

238
00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:01.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Shinichi, are you home?</i>

239
00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:10.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impressive.

240
00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:13.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did not expect her to elicit
such terror from you.

241
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's cold!

242
00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:17.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why must you do that, Shinichi?

243
00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You took the bus yesterday evening,
didn't you?

244
00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where did you go?

245
00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Satomi was worried about you, too.

246
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, nowhere really.

247
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, we are under attack.

248
00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I sense nothing
but killing intent from it.

249
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-Sensei?

250
00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:44.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

251
00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:47.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fool.

252
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone, help!

253
00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:58.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, are you all right?

254
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have an intruder.

255
00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Call the police!

256
00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:05.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Evacuate the students!

257
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:08.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You will now study on your own.

258
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're under attack? From who?

259
00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most likely the male we met yesterday.

260
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:20.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold it!

261
00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:23.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did you enter the school grounds
without permission?

262
00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:25.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come with me!

263
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He just neutralized three obstacles.

264
00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:38.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean he killed people?

265
00:15:38.812 --> 00:15:40.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I am not sure,</i>

266
00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>but he is certainly brash.</i>

267
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:43.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A knife?

268
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:47.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dear God! The intruder has a knife?

269
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>This is an emergency announcement!</i>

270
00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:52.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>There is an intruder in the building!</i>

271
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:53.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-<i>Students are to follow</i>

272
00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>their teachers' instructions</i>
-An intruder?

273
00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Evacuate?
-<i>and evacuate to the school grounds.</i>

274
00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't remember them saying
there'd be a safety drill today.

275
00:15:58.582 --> 00:15:59.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>…in groups according to class.</i>

276
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I repeat. There is</i>
<i>an intruder in the building.</i>

277
00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:04.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dammit! I can't believe
he's doing this in broad daylight!

278
00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:07.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's optimistic about his chances
and lacks forethought.

279
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>…and evacuate to the school grounds.</i>
-He's not at all like Tamiya Ryoko.

280
00:16:10.177 --> 00:16:12.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, where is she, anyway?

281
00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:15.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She is approximately 150 meters away.

282
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:19.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It appears she intends
to observe our fight.

283
00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:21.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guess that's better than
her joining the enemy.

284
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Evacuate using the stairs near Wing C</i>

285
00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:27.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and do not approach Wing A</i>
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

286
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamiya-sensei!

287
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:30.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's not here?

288
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, come with me.

289
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't push!

290
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't push. Stay in line and keep moving.

291
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should fight, Shinichi.

292
00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fight? Why?

293
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our opponent strode in without any regard
for witnesses in broad daylight.

294
00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even if we run, he will come after us.

295
00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's better to take him out now.

296
00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:51.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But…

297
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Besides, we currently have the advantage.

298
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have a plan.

299
00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:58.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A plan?

300
00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:01.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, who have you been talking to?

301
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:04.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Oh, just thinking out loud.

302
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, think that's the intruder?

303
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Where?

304
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:11.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Over there. That middle-aged dude.

305
00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:12.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way!

306
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There really is an intruder!

307
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:17.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, stay in line!

308
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:22.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is attempting to pinpoint
your, no, my location,

309
00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:25.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but this crowd is preventing him.

310
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:27.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If…

311
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If he finds us, what will happen?

312
00:17:29.673 --> 00:17:32.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He will attack us, of course,

313
00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:35.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
along with everyone around us.
He will not hold back.

314
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that is also what we want.

315
00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:40.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What we want?

316
00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:44.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As he scythes down the people around you,

317
00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:47.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will move swiftly to pierce his heart.

318
00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:48.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's simplistic,

319
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:50.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it has a high probability of success.

320
00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The people around me?

321
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's your…

322
00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:56.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, that's my plan.

323
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:59.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are being protected by a shield,
a "wall of meat", you could say.

324
00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:03.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To A, it should pose
a most inconvenient obstacle.

325
00:18:03.707 --> 00:18:05.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A "wall of meat".

326
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:08.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had forgotten what you are!

00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:12.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Murano!
-Izumi-kun!

328
00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:15.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you forget something?

329
00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:16.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll come with you!

330
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:18.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't come near me! Get away from me!

331
00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:20.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

332
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh… Sorry!

333
00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:24.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just get out of here and take refuge fast!

334
00:18:33.737 --> 00:18:35.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the matter, Shinichi?

335
00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did not find my plan to your liking?

336
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not!

337
00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many people do you intend to kill?

338
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:43.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's to protect myself.

339
00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:47.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You sacrifice other lives
so that your own life can continue.

340
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is how animals live.

341
00:18:50.337 --> 00:18:52.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your Japanese is really good.

342
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:56.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You understand human speech so well,

343
00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:57.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
yet, why do you…

344
00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I remember now.

345
00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:02.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Humans are one-of-a-kind creatures
that commit suicide.

346
00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:05.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not that I want to die.

347
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you doing?

348
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a better option
than using a wall of meat.

349
00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Class 3-2!

350
00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stay in line!

351
00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:18.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you upset, Migi?

352
00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Upset?

353
00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:22.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do not have time for that.

354
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must think of our next move.

355
00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:29.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shinichi, what do you think
separates us from A?

356
00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What separates us?

357
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's a killer

358
00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm a morally upright
high school student.

359
00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:38.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He can become someone else.

360
00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:39.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't.

361
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:41.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's one.

362
00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am two.

363
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that true?
-Huh?

364
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:49.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does A perceive us
as being two distinct entities?

365
00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:50.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

366
00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's your weapon, Shinichi.

367
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:00.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"My" weapon?

368
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:01.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

369
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A and I are just about evenly matched.

370
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So there is only one solution.

371
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:09.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must join in the fight.

372
00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:12.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you become flustered and hold me back,

373
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we will lose.

374
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the other hand, if you fight
effectively, we will win.

375
00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:20.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Effectively"? How?

376
00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:23.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We delegate roles.

377
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See…

378
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:32.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will that really work?

379
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, let's try it out.

380
00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:37.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Conceal that weapon.

381
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:45.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It's true that Migi is far more</i>
<i>of a combat expert than I am.</i>

382
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:48.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He's already killed two of his kind.</i>

383
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:52.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Right. I just have to trust him.</i>

384
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:53.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's coming, Shinichi.

385
00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:55.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A is within three meters of us.

386
00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:56.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three meters?

387
00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:59.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where?

388
00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:01.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't see him!
-He's directly below us.

389
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:16.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was that meant to be a barricade?

390
00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've only cut off your escape route.

391
00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:49.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
