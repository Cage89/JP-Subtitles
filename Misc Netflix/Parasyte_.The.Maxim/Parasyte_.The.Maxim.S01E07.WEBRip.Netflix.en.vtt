Don't move!

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not her?

3
00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It wasn't her.

4
00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this one's a monster, too, right?

5
00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hang on a second!

6
00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is it, Migi?

7
00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He still has his human brain.

8
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, this is pretty unusual.

10
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just the hand, huh?

11
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa!

12
00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How is that a human brain?

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, he's right!

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really--

15
00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the real deal, see?

16
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's true, Shinichi.

17
00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His brain is intact.

18
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From the lower half of his face
to the front of his neck

19
00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and perhaps down to his chest is where…

20
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

21
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we're in the same boat!

25
00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:01.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

28
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautiful.

29
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A snake?

30
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

31
00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then…

32
00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll finish.

33
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your right hand should have
some recollection of this, too.

34
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At first, "Take over the brain"
is our only goal,

35
00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I was working my way
toward the brain, but…

36
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

43
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. Interesting.

44
00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, yeah, that's how I…

45
00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
LET ME TALK, TOO

46
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I give you control over
my upper body,

47
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't be as dynamic when I talk!

48
00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up!

49
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this sure was a surprise.

50
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When this guy suddenly said one of
his own kind was coming closer,

51
00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wasn't sure
what kind of monster I'd see.

52
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it was a relief to see you.

53
00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Man, I didn't know
there were others like me!

54
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, tell me.

55
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the story behind your right hand?

56
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, tell us.

57
00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

58
00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But before I do that,
can we go somewhere else?

59
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

60
00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm Izumi Shinichi.

61
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is Migi.

62
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just that we need to stay close
to a certain location.

63
00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm Uda Mamoru.

64
00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can just call him Parasite.

65
00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:42.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, Parasite's just fine.

66
00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's gone.

67
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where did he go?

68

SAKURAZAKI HOSPITAL

69
00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's horrible. It's too cruel!

70
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:56.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that's why you've stayed
near this hospital all this time.

71
00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It must be so hard on you.

72
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:02.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think I could bear it.

73
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

74
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why does this guy cry so much?

75
00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really don't get humans.

76
00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I sometimes feel the same way.

77
00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Migi has a very proper way
of speaking, doesn't he?

78
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Oh.

79
00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's probably because
he's read so many books.

80
00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I learned human speech from TV.

81
00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He loves watching movies, see,
and he's always crying over them.

82
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:30.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crying's pretty unique to humans, huh?

83
00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just be quiet for a second!

84
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I work at a hotel in the next town over.

85
00:06:39.273 --> 00:06:43.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll let you know the moment
this "enemy" of yours shows up.

86
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

87
00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let us help you!

88
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, you're the first person
like me I've ever met!

89
00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He really does cry a lot.</i>

90
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But I'm also glad.</i>

97
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's important.

98
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought about telling you
during the day,

99
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but since Uda and his parasite showed up,
I missed my chance.

100
00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remember what happened, Shinichi.

101
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You ran at the speed of an Olympic athlete

102
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and leapt more than three meters high.

103
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

104
00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't realize it?

105
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then allow me to explain.

106
00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First, about my own body.

107
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This requires practice, you know.

108
00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I just split in two,

109
00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:43.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
each of us is capable
of thought and speech.

110
00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if I split into fragments
that are too small,

111
00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
our intelligence is diminished

112
00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to the point that we will
become incapable of thought,

113
00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
much less rejoining the others.

114
00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'd shrivel up and die in no time.

115
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa.

116
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, when I split into multiple selves,
I issue a mental directive in advance.

117
00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A mantra, if you will.

118
00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Come back together as one."

119
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. I see.

120
00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:13.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, there are places
where even the smallest

121
00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of my fragments can survive.

122
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somewhere with a constant flow
of fresh blood.

123
00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Namely, anywhere within your body.

124
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My…

125
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, Migi, you--

126
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

127
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Migi who's talking to you right now

128
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
only accounts for about 70%
of my original self.

129
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>When I closed the hole in your heart,</i>

130
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I issued a directive to return to</i>
<i>your right hand via your bloodstream,</i>

131
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but your restored heart</i>
<i>was much stronger than I'd expected,</i>

132
00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>so my fragments scattered</i>
<i>throughout your body.</i>

133
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have become so small that I can
no longer communicate with them.

134
00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:03.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the…

135
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And here, I thought nothing
could possibly surprise me anymore.

136
00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:10.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you didn't exhibit
any physiological changes,

137
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:12.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was going to keep quiet about it.

138
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:15.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Migi.

139
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes?

140
00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said throughout my body.

141
00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does that include my brain?

142
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:22.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

143
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the fragments are not conscious

144
00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:29.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I doubt they would bother
to infiltrate capillaries.

145
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:35.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you have some concern?
-No, it's nothing major.

146
00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I may just be imagining it.

147
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>At that time,</i>

148
00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:43.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I felt like my heart would burst from</i>
<i>all the emotions welling up inside me,</i>

149
00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>but I still couldn't cry.</i>

150
00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was the same earlier today, too.

151
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uda-san cried like a baby when he met

152
00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
someone like him
for the first time, but I…

153
00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crying's pretty unique to humans, huh?

154
00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hole in my heart, huh?

155
00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maki-chan.

156
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you knew I was here?

157
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do I look like
a normal human being to you?

158
00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Sure. Why?

159
00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:26.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jeez, what's your deal?

160
00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You get your answer and that's it?

161
00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't tell me anything.

162
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

163
00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Back on the boat and now, too,

164
00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:40.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you have this terrible look
on your face sometimes, like…

165
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like you're crying inside!

166
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:45.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

167
00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It makes me worry about you.

168
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

169
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just forget it!

170
00:10:58.407 --> 00:10:59.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's Uda-san.

171
00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It's here! A parasite!</i>

172
00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>We think it must be your enemy!</i>

173
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

174
00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:09.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she's heading straight here?

175
00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:12.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, she seems to have noticed us
and is coming closer.

176
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:15.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll do our best
to keep her here until you come.

177
00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:16.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

178

179
00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>she'll attack,</i>
<i>no matter what you tell her!</i>

180
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

181
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's a hundred meters away.

182
00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:26.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurry! Get out of there!

183
00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:27.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay!

184
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll follow the cape and head to
the town where you are now!

185
00:11:45.746 --> 00:11:48.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, I'm detecting one parasite.

186
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One?

187
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That must be Uda-san.

188
00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:58.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurry up! She'll catch up to us!

189
00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:01.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the best I can do!

190
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:05.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like she's able to maximize
the potential of the human body.

191
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't stand a chance against her.

192
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's make a break for it!
-We can't!

193
00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:12.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi-kun and Migi will be here soon.

194
00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have to work together to beat her!

195
00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then, go that way!

196
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll have a better chance there.

197
00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:21.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can sense the other one?

199
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I'm tired.

200
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to be kidding me!

201
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:29.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't stay awake any longer.

202

203
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you going to let Uda-san

204
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:36.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least, I can leave you this.

205

00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:46.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hey, the path ends here.

211
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

212
00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:04.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, even if she catches up to us,

213
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you and Shinichi can flank her here.

214
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:19.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're the second one I've met
whose brain is intact.

215
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But to me, you are just a hindrance.

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:35.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is what the "finished product"
that we're supposed to be looks like!

218
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

219
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:41.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

220
00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:03.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:06.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

223
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the human that you reside in is sluggish.

224
00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:20.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a pretty simple pattern,

227
00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:24.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as if she's only targeting
one spot on our body.

228
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:48.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In cases like yours, when it's unclear
how far the parasite's influence reaches,

231
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
destroying the heart
is the most effective approach.

232
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

239
00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:24.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

240
00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:27.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

241
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose I should've cut

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:35.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

244
00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't waste any time killing you!

00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:49.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
