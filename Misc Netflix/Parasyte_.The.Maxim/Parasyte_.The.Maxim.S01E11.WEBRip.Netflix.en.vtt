Gosh, I drank way too much!

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I should get going.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, wait.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the hurry?

5
00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Katou-san,
you're so handsome and dependable.

6
00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:22.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've put me on the spot.
-You're really my type.

7
00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, do you know about this?

8
00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oops, sorry.

9
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't mean to pull out three--

10
00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:42.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

11
00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've put me on the spot.

12
00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hair gave me away.

13
00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Help me out.

14
00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't care for meat
that contains alcohol.

16
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:14.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You saved my life.

<i>I can't believe</i>

19
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:42.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How are Izumi and I similar?

20
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, whatever you're sensing

21
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:50.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
might be weird wavelengths
given off by dangerous guys like him.

22
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But Izumi? Could he be…</i>

23
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You shouldn't do that without warning.

24
00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

25
00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:17.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you want to pluck
one of my hairs, go ahead.

26
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

27
00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:19.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I will.

28
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Satisfied?

29
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait!

30
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Remember how you warned me
before about Shimada?

31
00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you know who he was from the start?

32
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, not really.

33
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess that makes sense.

34
00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:51.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wouldn't know
a mass murderer like him.

35
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why the serious look?

36
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>This girl's special.</i>

37
00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Maybe I should just tell her everything.</i>

38
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But Migi's awake.</i>

39
00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:08.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Shinichi, I know what you're thinking,</i>

40
00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>but that female is no ally of mine.</i>

41
00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your name is Kana, right?

42
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

43
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, yeah.

44
00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:27.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said you have some mysterious
telepathic ability to sense me,

45
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but even if you feel that I'm close,
you should stay away.

46
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

47
00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:35.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You might run into a monster.

48
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A monster?
-Yeah.

49
00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you think that?

50
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aren't you a normal human being?

51
00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:44.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I am.

52
00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:50.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then, if I get that feeling from anyone,
I'll just pluck out one of their hairs.

53
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I'll know if they're a monster or--

54
00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! You can't do that!

55
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

56
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

57
00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But seriously, it's too dangerous.

58
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're worried about me?

59
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That kind of makes me happy.

60
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

61
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to talk to you.

62
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I just remembered
something I have to do.

63
00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, later.

64
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

65
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you're…

66
00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

67
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shinichi, don't talk
to that female anymore.

68
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't agree to that.

69
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I leave her be,
she'll get herself into danger for sure.

70
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the way you talk to her
gives her all kinds of hints.

71
00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be more careful.

72
00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I expect nothing less.

73
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:48.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, I know asking you this
out of nowhere might seem weird, but…

74
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is it?

75
00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you think Izumi-kun
has changed a lot from before?

76
00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:57.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's hard for me to compare.

77
00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not like I see him that often.

78
00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm talking about when you first
met him compared to now.

79
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you guys have a fight?
You like him, right?

80
00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's just different somehow.

81
00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not noticeable
when we're talking, but…

82
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He saved my life, too.

83
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Saved your life?
You have dreams like that, too?

84
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Dreams?

85
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, I mean…

86
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't see any difference.

87
00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In a way, I feel like
he was always like that.

88
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He kind of has this ferocity to him.

89
00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don't get
that mopey look off your face,

90
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you'll lose him.

91
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Maybe I still have a chance.</i>

92
00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be back in ten.

93
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

94
00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But couldn't you have tried
to blend in a little?

95
00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The clothes will get soiled anyway.

96
00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:19.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need something?

97
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many of you are inside?

98
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You stupid or something?

99
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beat it before you get yourself hurt!

100
00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:26.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

101
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The yakuza are very belligerent,
aren't they?

102
00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:34.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes you run into people
who get the silly idea

103
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the yakuza can't harm civilians
because of anti-gang laws!

104
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

105
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

106
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

What's the matter?

109
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:41.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come at me.

110
00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:55.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's one.

111
00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You monster!

112
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two.

113
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We got him.

114
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three, huh.

115
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

116
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I failed to avoid three.

117
00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess that's about par.

118
00:11:24.892 --> 00:11:26.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Monster.

119
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell are you here for?

120
00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is an experiment

121
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:38.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to see how far we can go against
a group with guns and edged weapons.

122
00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did something happen?

123
00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:43.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a body over there.
His head's been bashed in.

124
00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just heard gunshots, too.

125
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seriously?

126
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, he's running away!

127
00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After him!

128
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? He's gone.

129
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's weird.

130
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:08.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know he came this way.

131
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Drop it.

132
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We wouldn't want to get
drawn into a gang war.

133
00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:16.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should we at least call the cops?

134
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure someone already has.

135
00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:35.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is it?

136
00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:39.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, it's just that you look
very different from before.

137
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A massacre at a yakuza office.

138
00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:45.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They say there were 22 casualties,

139
00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which includes everyone
who was at the office.

140
00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:54.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A lot of scary things
are happening one after another.

141
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:55.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

142

143
00:12:57.026 --> 00:13:01.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't hold back at all.

149
00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was good exercise, boss.

150
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun!

151
00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:35.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for coming.

152
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:36.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No problem.

153
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for the invite.

154
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:46.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What are you up for?
-Let's watch a movie, for starters.

155
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:47.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay!

SADAKO 2D - BLOOD WILL BE DEFEATED

157
00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:03.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still have dreams
about what happened that day.

158
00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:08.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even after I wake up,
I can't stop shaking.

159
00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does that ever happen to you, Izumi-kun?

160
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sometimes.

161
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:16.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But by the time morning comes,
I've forgotten most of it.

162
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That must be nice.

163
00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My dreams are so vivid and colorful
that I remember them pretty clearly.

164
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My friend once told me this.

165
00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:32.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said to think of people
like cattle and pigs.

166
00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you do that,

167
00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:38.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you realize that people eat
chopped-up animals every day,

168
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:41.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you shouldn't have anything
to be afraid of after that.

169
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's unusual.

170
00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of person is he?

171
00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:50.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, well. I don't know
about "person", but…

172
00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:54.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder if your friend's
one reason you've changed.

173
00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:57.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think so.

174
00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry.

175
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:03.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've changed, but it's nothing
you need to worry about.

176
00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:07.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

177
00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:12.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Maybe Izumi-kun hasn't really</i>

178
00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Izumi-kun, remember when your dad
got injured while on a trip and…

179
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go.

180
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:29.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I guess I shouldn't have</i>
<i>asked him about it.</i>

181
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. So cute!

182
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

183
00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That must be his mom.

184
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Must be.

185
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

186
00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess not.

187
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

188
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

190
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

191
00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:09.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

192

200
00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

201

207
00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:01.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I can't ignore her when she says
it's the last favor she'll ever ask.

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:39.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

238
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

239
00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:44.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not just one but three.

242
00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:48.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're that way.

00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:58.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It appears they are aware of our presence,
but they aren't taking any action.

246
00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:00.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm suddenly realizing

247
00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:04.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that we're kind of like Kitaro
and his dad, from the cartoon.

248
00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:06.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are approximately 60 meters away.

249
00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:08.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eight of them total.

250
00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:11.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two are close to the ground
and six are high up.

251
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:20.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is difficult in the extreme
to consider reversing

254
00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the progress we have made
as a civilization.

255
00:20:22.262 --> 00:20:24.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, if we do not,
at least in some aspects…

256
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The six of them up there.
They're all parasites?

257
00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:28.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two below, too.

258
00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At this distance,
it is difficult to identify them,

259
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we may be able to
if we make eye contact.

260
00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:35.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

261
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:43.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

262
00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:45.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

263
00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:46.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

264
00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:48.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our eyes met,

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:51.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to be very interested in us.

266
00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:53.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
let's get out of here for now.

268
00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:55.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:07.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

274
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I live in this neighborhood,

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:11.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
