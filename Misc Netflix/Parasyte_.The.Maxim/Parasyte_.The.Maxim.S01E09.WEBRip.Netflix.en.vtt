What?

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

5
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's none of your business

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would rather avoid causing trouble,

9
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I went easy on you.

10
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:02.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But should you come looking
for a fight again for no good reason,

11
00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll end you.

You're Izumi Shinichi-kun, right?

18
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

19
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, um…

20
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

21

Oh, no, I am Izumi.

23
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Murano.

24
00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Murano Satomi.

25
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were assigned to the same room
for the entrance exam.

26
00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right. Sorry.

27
00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was so tense, I didn't notice
anything going on that day.

28
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See you in April.

29
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope we'll be in the same class!

30
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

31

33
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>If I send a strong signal with no warning,</i>
<i>he should react reflexively.</i>

34
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Especially if I radiate hostility!</i>

35
00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He's way too dense.</i>

36
00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hide's a real hottie, huh?

37
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Oh, I don't really--

38
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't try to hide it.

39
00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you drew his face.

40
00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? You snooped?

41
00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's so cool.

42
00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never seen a guy as hot as him.

43
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder if he's had plastic surgery.
What if his face is fake?

44
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nah. No way.

45
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:54.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, draw his face for me sometime, too.

46
00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be waiting!

47
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fake?

48
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why can't we go public?

49
00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our greatest fear

50
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:14.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is triggering widespread panic
due to a lack of credible information.

51
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When people stop trusting each other,

52
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'll lead to discrimination and fear,

53
00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then scaremongering and mass hysteria.

54
00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's my son, Shinichi.

55
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello. Nice to meet you.

56
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In any event,

57
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we do not yet possess the means
to distinguish them from normal humans.

58
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is nothing to be gained
by going public now.

59
00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are truly sorry about your wife.

60
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
However, if we may be blunt,

61
00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:54.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the current situation is akin to
"just" having a few thousand or fewer

62
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"savage beasts" roaming around Japan.

63
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, how is the sketch this time?

64
00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it was just like this.

65
00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

66
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it can morph into anything.

67
00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Literally, anything's possible.

68
00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It appears there are quite</i>
<i>a few rumors going around.</i>

69
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it seems.

70
00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we could have foreseen this.

71
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:35.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we continue
mindless predation like insects,

72
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:40.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we will be hunted down and eradicated.

73
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What weak and imperfect life forms we are.

74
00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:49.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're probably the only one
who's given it so much thought.

75
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:52.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I only have one question.

76
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is the purpose of our existence?

77
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The answer is simple.

78
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Man has become toxic to Earth
and there was a need for a neutralizer.

79
00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:13.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I am nurturing a toxin within me.

80
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did your visitors leave?

81
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Savage beasts", huh?

82
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've decided to tell
at least you the truth.

83
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it's about Mom.

84
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

85
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I nodded as Dad spoke, without</i>

86
00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>Today we're asking Professor Big Mouth</i>

90

<i>Hey, I'm talking here!</i>
<i>You think this is lion dance time?</i>

91
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-oh. He passed out again.

92
00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's this? Gross.

93
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't look at that!

94
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:25.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is for an ongoing investigation!

95
00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, so that's your suspect?

96
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not! This is a monster!

97
00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:35.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyway. Did you need something?

98
00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

99
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I wanted you to take a look at this.

100
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he a friend of yours?

101
00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's good work.

102
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have talent.

103
00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:50.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, does anything about him
strike you as odd?

104
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like, maybe his personality
or his way of thinking?

105
00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You draw faces for a living,

106
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you can tell, right?

107
00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:00.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to be kidding.

108
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not when this is all I've got to go on.

109
00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

110
00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:21.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

112
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey! Heads up!

113
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:39.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh… Are you okay?

114
00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

115
00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:53.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A… A fake face.

116
00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Murano!

118
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About the other day, that was…

119
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it wasn't anything serious.

120
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was just messing with me.

121
00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So…

122
00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

123
00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What, Migi?

124
00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:27.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now's not a good time.

125
00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sensing hostility in Shimada.

126
00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe I said I'd end you,
but if you insist.

127
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go somewhere…

128
00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:43.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
away from prying eyes.

129
00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:48.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He has four to six targets,
most likely all human.

130
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It will be a massacre.

131
00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:53.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun?

132
00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you want to intervene,
I can give you their location.

133
00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you want to do?
-What choice do I have?

134
00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:03.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun?

135
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This guy's being way too accommodating.

136
00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:17.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe he doesn't get
the situation he's in.

137
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You guys don't get to touch him.
He's mine.

138
00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can all come at me at once.

139
00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Someone who's something
of a pest is on his way here.

140
00:11:33.442 --> 00:11:35.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we're going to do this,
it should be soon.

141

142
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi?

143
00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:46.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He must have jumped</i>

144
00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Did his right hand help him?</i>

145
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

146
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shimada!

147
00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:53.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've finally shown what you really are!

148
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I really am?

149
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want to fight me here, then?

150
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't seek out this situation.

151
00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm the victim here.

152
00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't that right?

153
00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:10.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go.

154
00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:12.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take care of the rest.

155
00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

156
00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:15.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll leave you to it, then.

157
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, wait!

158
00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:26.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're going to run?

159
00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

160
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

162

163
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just go home.

164
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And never go after that guy again.

165
00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:48.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

174
00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:33.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

179
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

181
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just wondering

182
00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

183
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

184
00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:19.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bet you beat all of them up.

185
00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:20.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

186
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't do any of that!

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

188
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

189
00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:36.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

190
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did something happen
between you and Shimada-kun?

191
00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:43.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

192
00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He might look harmless,
but he's a shit-faced asshole!

193
00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:49.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

194
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not being yourself, Izumi-kun.

195
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

196
00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

197
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

198
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:03.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know how to put it,

199
00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:06.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the Izumi-kun I know isn't
someone who says things like that.

200
00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:11.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To me, it looks like

201
00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not trying too hard.

202
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not true.

203
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're a completely different person now.

204
00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:23.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've changed.

205
00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I may have changed,
but I'm not trying hard at it.

206
00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:29.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you different, then?

207
00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:32.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who can change like that

208
00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:40.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

209
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up!

210
00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:50.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

211
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's because of the hole in my chest.

212
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:06.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could also be characterized
as a hole in your back.

213
00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:09.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From my perspective,
you have become stronger.

214
00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:13.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps not so much as a person
but more as a life form.

215
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:15.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You stay calm, no matter what happens,

216
00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:17.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you quickly recover from dips
