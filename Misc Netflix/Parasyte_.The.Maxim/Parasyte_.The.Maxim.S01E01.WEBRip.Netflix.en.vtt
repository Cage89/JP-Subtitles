00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you?

111
00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:41.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tired.

112
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sleep.
-Huh?

113
00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hang on a second!

114
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have tons of questions
I want to ask you! Hey!

115
00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, come on!

116
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi? Is something wrong?

117
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, did you hear me?

118
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't come in!

119
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing's wrong.

120
00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
TALKING RIGHT HAND

121
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
TALKING RIGHT HAND WEIRD SNAKE

122
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
BURROW INTO HUMAN

123
00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing that seems relevant.

124
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I guess no one else
has had this problem.

125
00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, dinner's ready!

126
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got a call from the school.

127
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They said you left early.

128
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did something happen?

129
00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really.

130
00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:49.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just didn't feel well.

131
00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:51.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

132
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you're having seconds?

133
00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:55.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's unusual.

134
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you don't feel well,
but you do have an appetite?

135
00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel better now.

136
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:02.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does it matter?

137
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I can't tell Mom or Dad</i>

138
00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:16.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love you, love you, love you lots!

139
00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wall slam!

140
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oops. I had a bit too much.

141
00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Drank too much.

142
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:38.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nakamura-san, your laundry.

143
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:47.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No. I can't tell anyone about this.</i>

144
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:51.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Even if I went to the cops,</i>
<i>they'd just think I'm crazy.</i>

145
00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

146
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>there would be a huge uproar.</i>

147
00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What should I do?</i>

148
00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hey, wake up already.</i>

149
00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's morning?

150
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's morning.

151
00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:22.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's finally morning and still…

152
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm stuck in a nightmare.

153
00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:36.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you doing?

154
00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just what it looks like.

155
00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:40.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm studying.

156
00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you can talk normally now?

157
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what are you, anyway?

158
00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:48.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't tell me you're an alien?

159
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Alien"?

160
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's that?

161
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That snake-like thing is what
you really look like, right?

162
00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:05.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won't deny that none of the biology
books I checked had anything about me.

163
00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:08.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you really come from outer space?

164
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:12.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know where I came from.

165
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The earliest memory I have

166
00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:18.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is the sense of how unfortunate
it was that I couldn't take the brain.

167
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"The brain"?

168
00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't mean…

169
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:24.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you going after my brain next?

170
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that were possible,
I would have done so already.

171
00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:27.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's not.

172
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's too late now that I've matured
without having eaten your brain.

173
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite unfortunate.

174
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:36.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What would've happened if you'd
succeeded in taking my brain?

175
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You probably would have become

176
00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:41.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a life form resembling a human
but with a head that morphs.

177
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gross.

178
00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why me, anyway?

179
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:46.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coincidence.

180
00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:49.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't choose you specifically.

181
00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:55.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess I have to go to
a hospital now, uproar or not.

182
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would you do that?

183
00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To have them cut you off.

184
00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:00.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would be undesirable.

185
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:04.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feed on the nutrients carried by
your bloodstream to survive.

186
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, if I were to be cut off,

187
00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:08.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would shrivel up and die.

188
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:12.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Plus, you would lose your right hand.

189
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'd be a loss for both of us.

190
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Both of us"?

191
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're the one who ate my right hand
without even asking first!

192
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about this?

193
00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll fine-tune the circuitry
so that while I'm asleep,

194
00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can control the hand just like before.

195
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

196
00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's sufficient, no?

197
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving forward, we should
cooperate and coexist.

198
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is our only option.

199
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

200
00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:41.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who said you get to decide?

201
00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:43.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm tired, so I'm going to sleep.

202
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait a minute!

203
00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:46.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You always do that when things
get inconvenient for you!

204
00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Use me with care.

205
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:58.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm supposed to clean this up?

206
00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's my bacon and eggs?

207
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:08.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said you didn't want any yesterday.

208
00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:11.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said I should have
a proper breakfast, right?

209
00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:13.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I have more toast, too?

210
00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're so fickle.

211
00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:18.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Violent incidents are happening
all over the nation.

212
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Another murder?

213
00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:20.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

214
00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A mother and her daughter were killed.

215
00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not only were their bodies
in terrible shape,

216
00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it also seems the father
is the killer and now he's missing.

217
00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:32.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There was also a dismembering in Osaka

218
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a murder in Miyagi where
the body was hung up like laundry.

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not when we're eating, dear.

220
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oops, sorry.

221
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Shinichi, look.

222
00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:53.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're fine with them now?

223
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine with what?

224
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you and bugs…

225
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a different route from yesterday.

226
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're awake?

227
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:15.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are you going?

228
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I decided to talk to the police.

229
00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:20.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't do that.

230
00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:24.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be isolated and turned into
an experimental subject or a sample.

231
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:27.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Either way, you won't be able
to lead a normal life anymore.

232
00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I do, then?

233
00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:31.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I already told you this morning.

234
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:33.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To cooperate and coexist is our only…

235
00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

236
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not so loud!

237
00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:40.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of mine is close.

238
00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:41.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

239
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"One of mine" as in another of my species.

240
00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:45.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you say?

241
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. How can you tell?

242
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:50.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can sense something like brain waves.

243
00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:53.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's my first time sensing it,
but I can tell it's one of mine.

244
00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:56.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about 200 meters straight that way.

245
00:16:56.265 --> 00:17:00.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are other people who went
through the same thing as me?

246
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

247
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go right.

248
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi?

249
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

250
00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:17.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turn left up ahead.

251
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:21.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It seems the other has sensed me, too.

252
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:26.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

253
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go.

254
00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:29.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said it's one of you.

255
00:17:29.673 --> 00:17:32.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could it be a person
who's had his brain taken over?

256
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Possibly.

257
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:35.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

258
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:36.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's creepy as hell.

259
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:47.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to know what exactly I am.

260
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That information should be
valuable to you, as well.

261
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:54.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine.

262
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Twenty meters more.

263
00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's around that corner.

264
00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:02.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It seems to be eating.
-What?

265
00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:14.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A dog's eating another dog?

266
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:23.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You also failed?

267
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please stop talking.

268
00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:33.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You with your location in your host.

269
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me with my animal host.

270
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Both dissatisfied.

271
00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Run!
-What?

272
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Run! Hurry!

273
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What the hell? You told me to go there
and now you tell me to run?

274
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I sensed that it wants to kill you!

275
00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:54.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It harbors an intense suspicion
toward you because you are still human.

276
00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:05.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It intends to fight.

277
00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:06.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll fight here.

278
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:09.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Fight?

279
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:17.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it kills you, I'll die, too.

280
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here it comes.

281
00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the…

282
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to be kidding me!

283
00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:25.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's way out of line!

284
00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that its heart?

285
00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:43.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look.

286
00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:44.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about to die.

287
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was living off the dog's organs
and digestive system, as I'd suspected.

288
00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:58.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had no idea there were more of you.

289
00:19:58.113 --> 00:20:00.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Its core was only the head.

290
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:04.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It controls the rest of the body
by seizing control of the nervous system,

291
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but because the core itself
morphed into wings,

292
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
its focus was dispersed,
creating a gap in its defenses.

293
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:13.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you'd finally found
one of your own kind.

294
00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:15.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A dog, huh?

295
00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:18.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose it's partially due to
its maturation environment,

296
00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:20.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it was negligent with its studies.

297
00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:21.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I was victorious.
