00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:12.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

45
00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:27.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hirama-san, we can't
drag this out much longer.

47
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at Izumi Shinichi.

48
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He kept his cool during our questioning,

49
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but even he seems to be afraid this time.

50
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

No.

54
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

55
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what caught my attention

56
00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
wasn't anything like that.

57
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just distracted me, that's all.

58
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What distracted you?</i>

59
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It turned out I was just imagining it,

60
00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:11.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I thought I saw something

61
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:14.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not entirely human deep within his eyes.

62
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What?</i>

63
00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Idiot. Don't yell right into my ear.

64
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you I was just imagining it.

65
00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I took a good, long look,

66
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there was nothing to it.

67
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you will be staying at a hotel
for a few more days, at least.

68
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We will have someone accompany you

69
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
any time you want to visit your home,

70
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

71
00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's really unnecessary.

72
00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I insist.

73
00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hirama-san?

74
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About the baby.

75
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're referring to the one
Tamura Reiko was holding in her arms,

76
00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it still needs to undergo testing.

77
00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After all, the child
was being raised by a parasite.

78
00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, once you're sure the baby
is normal, what then?

79
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the child will be raised
in appropriate facilities.

80
00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:24.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do you ask?
Does the child concern you that much?

81
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

82
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well…

83
00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:32.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you were to say
you're Tamura Reiko's relative,

84
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd ask if you'd like to have custody.

85
00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

86
00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was kidding.

87
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

88
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

89
00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, need the bath?

90
00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You go ahead.

91
00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, thanks.

92

95
00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:21.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shinichi, it appears that you
are not only tired in body

96
00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but also exhausted in spirit.

97
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I met someone really scary
while you were asleep.

98
00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A human?

99
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

100
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think he was a killer.

101
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what to think anymore.

102
00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are humans who are
unfathomable and terrifying,

103
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that man-eating parasite,
Tamura Reiko,

104
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
saved me.

105
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She healed the hole in my heart.

106
00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I still cannot comprehend her behavior.

107
00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>We are two halves of the same whole.</i>

108
00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:19.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Regarding
the "Legal Analysis of Critical Response

110
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and Operation Planned
to Mitigate Massacre by Parasites",

111
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
technically, the government
has approved this operation,

112
00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:31.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but keep in mind
that there are many gray areas.

113
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I look forward to working with you,
Inspector Hirama.

114
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm only an assistant inspector.

115
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But there's talk that you may be promoted

116
00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
straight to superintendent
by the day of the operation.

117
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Surely you're joking.

118
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's been assigned to command
the ground forces during the operation--

119
00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm Yamagishi.

120
00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As you have already heard,

121
00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hirama-kun will be supporting
this operation

122
00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
by overseeing all the support functions

123
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and Yamagishi-kun
will oversee the core operation

124
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with regard to identifying
and eliminating the enemy.

125
00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Director General,

126
00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the man named Uragami
I spoke of previously

127
00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:17.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
may be a great asset,
depending on how we use him.

128
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe it'd be best to incorporate him

129
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as an integral element
in our core strategy.

130
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I appreciate the thought,

131
00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but regarding this "super ability" of his,

132
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hear he's a mass murderer.

133
00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Having such a foreign element working
with our tactical forces in an operation

134
00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
may result in mishaps at a critical point.

135
00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, he doesn't need to be
a part of the tactical force.

136
00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd just like him to function
as a pair of eyes.

137
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:45.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eyes, eh?

138
00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:50.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we have a sensing system
in place for that purpose.

139
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are not a flock of sheep
who can be herded by dogs.

140
00:09:55.469 --> 00:09:59.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You seem to give
their possible humanity too much credit.

141
00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not intended to be a manhunt

142
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but an extermination of pests.

143
00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:12.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have lost contact with Tamura Reiko.

144
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The same goes for Kusano,
Hikawa, and Maesawa.

145
00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:21.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Three mangled bodies were found
in a construction site within the city

146
00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:26.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a female thought to be a parasite was
shot to death the following day in a park.

147
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:31.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not to mention, all the bodies
were retrieved by a specialized agency

148
00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and their identities
have not been revealed.

149
00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:39.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kusano had always borne animosity
toward Tamura Reiko.

150
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He must have plotted
to kill her without our consent

151
00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:46.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and been killed by her instead.

152
00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:50.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then, the one who was shot dead
in the park was Tamura Reiko.

153
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most likely.

154
00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:56.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that a parasite task force agency
has been created,

155
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I no longer receive any information.

156
00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means the government is beginning
to treat this as a serious issue.

157
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It appears so.

158
00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun!

159
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Murano.

160
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry I made you worry.

161
00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:18.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay.

162
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wait.

163
00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Here are all the notes
I took while you were gone.

164
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks. I'll return them
once I make copies.

165
00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, look who's back!

166
00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:34.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you can come back to school
starting today?

167
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:37.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

168
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen up!

169
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is your last timed run
in high school!

170
00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give it all you've got so that
you won't have any regrets!

171
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Idiot.

172
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything he says is so over the top.

173
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi!

174
00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:53.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've always wanted to tell you this.

175
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:57.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You never take any of this seriously!
This is your last chance, so try for once!

176
00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If it were only that simple.</i>

177
00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Last time in high school, huh?</i>

178
00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Set!

179
00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
FURUYA

180
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
10.5 seconds?

181
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

182
00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It'd be easy to break ten seconds.</i>

183
00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:37.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are you getting changed in the corner
like you're hiding something?

184
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be so shy! You're a dude!

185
00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:48.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

186
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine.

187
00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:56.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Idiot.

188
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll be graduating in three months.

189
00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:18.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

190
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A lot of things happened in high school,
huh?

191
00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Way too much.

192
00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:30.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But there were good things, too.

193
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:32.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

194
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should study.

195
00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:38.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you actually going to take
university entrance exams?

196
00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:40.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's that supposed to mean?

197
00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:46.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, when I go to uni--

198
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go.

199
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We will win!

200
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:09.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm 99.9% certain,

201
00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:14.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I feel like we're just
missing one last thing.

202
00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:18.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what that is,
but there is something missing.

203
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd like your help.

204
00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why…

205
00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:28.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is it always Izumi-kun?

206
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:31.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun isn't the only one affected.

207
00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:37.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone here is trying their best
to forget what happened!

208
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were all supposed to be
leading perfectly normal lives,

209
00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:44.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like normal high school students,

210
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but just a little step off the track,

211
00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:51.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and there's blood everywhere!

212
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:01.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He seems to be a high school student.

213
00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:18.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:20.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

220
00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:25.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flamethrowers, for example.

221
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:33.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, fire won't be enough,
but I think it'll be effective.

223
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:36.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Basically, it'll startle us,

224
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

225
00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have intellect
on par with that of humans

226
00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we do not fear fire.

227
00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:50.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But should flames suddenly come near us,

228
00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there will be a disconnect between
our "outer" and "inner" selves.

229
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:56.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In short, we'd be startled.

230
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:01.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:05.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:07.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so if that one mind becomes startled,

233
00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:10.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it should unbalance him greatly.

234
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:11.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

235
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

236
00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:19.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forgive me.

237
00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:22.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:26.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

239
00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:29.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
