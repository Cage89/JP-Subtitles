63
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just came by because
you haven't been at school.

64
00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:19.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

65
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

at home sick and alone.

66

68
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

69
00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:48.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

83
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

84
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

85
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

86
00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:13.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you know where

87
00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:14.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

88
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

89
00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it was on the 18th, at dusk,
when your wife was murdered?

90
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

91
00:09:29.193 --> 00:09:33.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Has my wife's body been found?

92
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-san.

93
00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:37.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your wife is alive.

94
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

95
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the 18th,
the day you fell into the sea,

96
00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:47.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your wife returned alone
to the hotel after 9:00 p.m.

97
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's impossible!

98
00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:52.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She spoke with the front desk staff,

99
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
saying you had to leave early
on urgent business,

100
00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:57.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that she'd stay one more night.

101
00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then she checked out the next morning.

102
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. That's not possible.

103
00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was an imposter.

104
00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:13.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the staff saw the burn mark
on Nobuko-san's right arm,

105
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they're sure that's who they saw.

106
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-san.

107

For about four hours a day, I fall asleep.

217
00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:34.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it?

218
00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:36.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've slept before.

219
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:37.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not the same.

220
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:42.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Until now, even if I was asleep,
the slightest thing would wake me up.

221
00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:45.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For example, if you were surprised,
if your breathing became uneven,

222
00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:50.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or if one of my kind showed
up 300 meters away.

223
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of your kind.

224
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

225
00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:57.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But now, I'm unable to detect any of that
when I'm asleep.

226
00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:02.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, should an enemy appear
during those four hours,

227
00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'd mean the end for us both.

228
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had to detach from your right arm

229
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:12.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for a long time in order
to repair your heart.

230
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My physiology was slightly altered
as a result.

231
00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:20.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why didn't you tell me
something that important?

232
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It appears you harbor
strong animosity toward me

233
00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:26.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
now that one of my kind
has killed your mother.

234
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:31.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is dangerous to tell an enemy
about one's weakness.

235
00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:33.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I didn't tell you until now.

236
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I have decided that continuing
to keep you in the dark

237
00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:42.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would be even more dangerous.

238
00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:43.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

239
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:54.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think of you
as an enemy anymore, Migi.

240
00:17:55.699 --> 00:17:57.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:04.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
