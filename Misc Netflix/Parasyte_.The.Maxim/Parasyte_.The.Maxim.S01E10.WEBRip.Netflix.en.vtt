20
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That sound came from the Fine Arts room.

23
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

29
00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

159
00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:15.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:57.985 --> 00:12:58.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

169
00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:02.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

170
00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

he will eventually succumb.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:28.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so killing my kind
has no psychological effect on me.

221
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what if you were in my position?

222
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Saying this distresses him.</i>

223
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:42.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>This is what humans are.</i>

224
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Until now, we have been keeping
their existence a secret to avoid panic.

225
00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:51.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, perhaps it is now time
to make it public knowledge.

226
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But going public
will only lead to further chaos.

227
00:16:55.222 --> 00:17:00.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are rumors that they're trying
to weaponize parasites in the U.S.

228
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's go public.
-What?

229
00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:06.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And how do you intend to go about it?

230
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By public,

231
00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:10.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't necessarily mean revealing
the parasites' existence

232
00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:13.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but rather, implicitly suggesting
the means of distinguishing

233
00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
between human beings and parasites.

234
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And how will we do that?

235
00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:20.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. We have a way to do that?

236
00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To tell them apart?

237
00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:25.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll let Dr. Yui explain.

238
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll now explain
what we've uncovered so far

239
00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:33.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
regarding the parasite's physiology.

240
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This parasitic life form has the ability
to serve as the human brain,

241
00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:40.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that is, the command center
of the entire body,

242
00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to push it beyond
its physiological limits.

243
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:47.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their cells resemble neurons

244
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:51.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but could be characterized
as sentient muscle.

245
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Sentient muscle".

246
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
However, they are capable of much more.

247
00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They can morph in an instant

248
00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:02.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to stretch like rubber
or become as hard as steel.

249
00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:06.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then, how can such an alien cell type
form connections with the human body?

250
00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:10.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is accomplished by instantaneous
fusion between the two cell types.

251
00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:14.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's likely made possible by compounds
similar to polyethylene glycols,

252
00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-which act on the cell membrane to--
-Professor,

253
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:17.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
please tell us how
to tell them apart first.

254
00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:18.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

255
00:18:20.724 --> 00:18:21.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So…

256
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:26.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although they are sentient muscle,
when enough of their cells assemble,

257
00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:29.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they possess intelligence
on par with that of humans.

258
00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:33.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if there aren't enough,
what do you think happens?

259
00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:38.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they cannot secure blood circulation,
they shrivel up and die,

260
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so they try to fuse
with other cells of their kind.

261
00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:44.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should they become a fragment
about the size of a hair,

262
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
they may writhe out of survival instinct,

263
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
but they are too small

264
00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:49.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
to possess the necessary
intelligence to rejoin their kind.

265
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you pull out human hair,
nothing happens,

266
00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:56.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but if you pull out hair
from a camouflaged parasite,

267
00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the "hairs" will writhe
for several seconds

268
00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:02.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
before the cells separate and die.

269
00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In other words,

270
00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:08.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
pulling out a strand of hair
is one way to identify a parasite.

271
00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Professor.

272
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:15.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what if they wear wigs?

273
00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:16.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you harbor any suspicions,

274
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:19.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can try eyebrows or even nose hairs.

275
00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:23.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The idea is to isolate
a hair-sized mass from the main body.

276
00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:24.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

277
00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:26.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If that's the case…

278
00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:32.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I do apologize for the intrusion,
but before you all leave this room,

279
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:34.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I ask that you allow me
to pull out a strand of your hair.

280
00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:35.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

281
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although the possibility that
one of them is among us is low,

282
00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:41.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it is not zero.

283

<i>After a time, our school reopened.</i>

Are you doing okay now?

287
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

288
00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:05.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry
I didn't respond to your messages.

289
00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:06.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay.

290
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shall we go?

291
00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:12.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

292
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How is Tachikawa?

293
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yuko's better, too.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:22.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She said she'll come to school today.
-I see.

295
00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:25.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It sounded like she had a hell of a scare.

296
00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:29.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's always been a strong person.

297
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:30.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

298
00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:35.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been wanting to thank you.

299
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

300
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all in the past.

301
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:45.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's try to think of other things.

302
00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:46.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

304
00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:52.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You jumped down from pretty far up.

305
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:55.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I guess it was
an adrenaline rush or something.
