You could say your victory

8
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When it comes to killing,

9
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
nothing on Earth can match the human race.

10
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:14.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, the tools you currently hold
should be put to different use,

11
00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:18.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for a purpose far greater.

12
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They should be used
to protect the balance of the biosphere.

13
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That should be your intended mission.

14
00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In a word, culling.

15
00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:38.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that human numbers

17
00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that the crime of pollution

18
00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:47.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is far greater
than the crime of manslaughter,

19
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that our existence
is of such great importance

20
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that you will even come to protect us.

21
00:02:55.675 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should place greater value

22
00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:04.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And these particular predators

23
00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:07.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
fit perfectly into
the beautiful hierarchy of nature!

24
00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They fit right above humans!

27
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone on Earth had a sudden thought.

28
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

29
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just who do you think you are?
You monster!

30
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is why I can never like humans.

31
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If defiance is your final answer,
don't pretend otherwise at the start.

32
00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

33
00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:43.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
are all skewed in favor
of benefiting the human race!

34
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you refuse to acknowledge that?

35
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prioritize the prosperity of all life

36
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is what would make you
the superior species!

37
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You fools claim justice is on your side!

38
00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But what greater justice

39
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We inhabit humans

41
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:10.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In comparison, humans are the true
parasitic vermin infesting this planet!

42
00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

43
00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

44
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Parasitic beasts.

45
00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

47
00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a human.

48
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

49
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hirokawa.

50
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An inscrutable man until the very end.

51
00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:31.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tamura Reiko was greatly intrigued
by this human

52
00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

53
00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:43.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

59
00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

60
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

61
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

70
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To the roof. The roof, now!

109
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:47.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One more round.

110
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Didn't that round finish him?
-Don't let your guard down.

111
00:09:55.052 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We will exercise due caution
and engage the enemy on the roof.

112
00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He can navigate walls</i>
<i>and ceilings as well as any floor.</i>

113
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:07.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Indoor combat tactics</i>
<i>are useless against him.</i>

114
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>This is his lair,</i>

115
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and we are right in the thick of it.</i>

116
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>How ironic that we have lost our advantage</i>

117
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>in a man-made structure.</i>

118
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, scatter to both sides!

119
00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll engage him here!

120
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

121
00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:35.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impossible.

122
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're the only one left.

123
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I cleared out the men behind you.

124
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:45.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or perhaps saying I "scattered them"
would be more appropriate.

125
00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you even work?

126
00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't tell me that your body's also…

127
00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:56.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

128
00:10:56.989 --> 00:11:00.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I have not armored my entire body.

129
00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:02.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are gaps.

130
00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:07.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was somewhat careless in this fight,
given your sheer firepower.

131
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even if I harden my cells,

132
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
deflecting gunshots head-on
is not without risk.

133
00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:23.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why I deflect them
at an angle, like this.

134
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You dare mock me?

135
00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Also, though I dodge gunfire,

136
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it is not that I can move faster
than a bullet.

137
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:39.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I predict the direction of fire based on
the opponent's eye and hand movements.

138
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:49.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was that sound?

139
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:51.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it came from the roof.

140
00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:04.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who the hell are you?

141
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm what you see.

142
00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just a wild organism.

143
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An organism?

144
00:12:14.024 --> 00:12:16.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what are humans, then?

145
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Organisms.

146
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A flamethrower, huh?

147
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe that isn't such a bad idea.

148
00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:32.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, something just fell out of the sky.

149
00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

150
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:47.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you so.

151
00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you again.

152
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gotou.

153
00:12:54.064 --> 00:12:55.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

154
00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:57.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you were also involved.

155
00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a large battle, to be sure.

156
00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It seems all the others have been killed,

157
00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you were a part of it.

158
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The job is not yet finished.

159
00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:14.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Killing you should bring me closure.

160
00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:17.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right. I should kill you.

161
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I will move forward.

162
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Forward"?

163
00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not a bad aim,
if you were going for the heart.

164
00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:33.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impossible.

165
00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's finish this later.

166
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is too much interference,

167
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I am rather tired today.

168
00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He flew!

169
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun, what exactly are you?

170
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:53.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know!

171
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no idea!

172
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait!

173
00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:00.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We suffered heavy casualties.

174
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The majority were men
under Yamagishi's command,

175
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and all it took was one monster
to turn the tables on us.

176
00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:11.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you truly claim
you knew nothing about this?

177
00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:15.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're hiding something again, aren't you?

178
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:19.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know!

179
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:22.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had no idea that a single
one of them could be so powerful!

180
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A head!

181
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone's head just fell from the sky!

182
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:33.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi.

183
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:43.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi, that was quite a nightmare.

184
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you know what I dreamed about?

185
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:50.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a feeling.

186
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will Gotou come for us?

187
00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He most definitely will, and soon.

188
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I sensed his resolve.

189
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:02.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I guess we're going to die.

190
00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't give up that easily.

191
00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should get help.

192
00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:11.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uda, for example.

193
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:14.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. We can't drag them
into something like this.

194
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:17.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Humans, then.

195
00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll pit military forces
against him again.

196
00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:21.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How?

197
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:24.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if we do pull that off,
a lot of people will die again.

198
00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:27.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we'll be the ones
responsible for their deaths!

199
00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:29.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I couldn't care less.

200
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Migi.

201
00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:41.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You never change, Migi.

202
00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:47.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Dad, I might have to say goodbye soon.</i>

203
00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:53.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Mom, I might be able</i>
<i>to see you again soon.</i>

204
00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:59.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Hey, why don't we run somewhere far away?

205
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:04.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Not even Gotou is so obsessed with us
that he'd follow us all over Japan, is he?

206
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:05.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Migi.

207
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you asleep?

208
00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:15.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Oh, I forgot to go to school.

209
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
School.

210
00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:24.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Wait, he's asleep?</i>

211
00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:25.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Migi?</i>

212
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:35.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

213
00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:49.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If he attacks now…</i>

214
00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:57.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If he attacks now…

215
00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:00.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

216
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:03.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apologize.

217
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
