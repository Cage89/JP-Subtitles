00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good evening, Tamura-san.

2
00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:13.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems it's more difficult
to conceal than I'd thought.

3
00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:18.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, the strongest signal we are capable
of emanating is our intent to kill

4
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or just hostility.

5
00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you run, then?

6
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was curious.

7
00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I let it get the better of me.

8
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are there any others
who support this decision?

9
00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:38.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is just us three.

10
00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Neither Hirokawa nor Gotou are aware.

11
00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

12
00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is your reasoning?

13
00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My intuition.

14
00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:52.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You will pose a great threat to us all
in the future.

15
00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

16
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're like A.

17
00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"A"?

18
00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We parasites behave and think in ways

19
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that are very logical and clear-cut.

20
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had thought it would be easy enough
for us to create a united organization,

21
00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it appears I was wrong.

22
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, it makes me happy to realize
that parasites, myself included,

23
00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:21.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
have come to possess
individual differences of this magnitude,

24
00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or should I say, individuality.

25
00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, I am quite moved
by your decision to lynch me.

26
00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, this is farewell, then.

27
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you truly believe you could beat me
if there were three of you?

28
00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't let her get away!

29
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kill her!

30
00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

31
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:25.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DYING DETECTIVE

32
00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My body's muscle strength exceeds yours.

33
00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even in single combat, I would win.

34
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ignorance is bliss.

35
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not fast enough!

36
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can keep that.

37
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why did she split in two?

38
00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll go after her!

39
00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamura has entered his body?

40
00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You okay?

41
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

42
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There she is. That's her.

43
00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

44
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

45
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you putting pebbles in your bag?

46
00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To protect myself from perverts.

47
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, we mistook you for someone else.

48
00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:23.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We saw this lady
who only had half her head

49
00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you're dressed the same
as she was, so we just thoughtâ€¦

50
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Half her head?

51
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's weird.

52
00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But my head's empty!

53
00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She's beyond reason.</i>

54
00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Tamura is no longer capable</i>
<i>of rational thought.</i>

55
00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Besides, I doubt half a parasite</i>
<i>can maintain her bodily functions.</i>

56
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What she's doing is suicide.</i>

57
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Pointless.</i>

58
00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Is this how Tamura Reiko,</i>
<i>the one known for her intellect,</i>

59
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>will meet her end?</i>

60
00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:09.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My legs! My lower body!

61
00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you doing?

62
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not me!

63
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not me!

64
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>One of us died?</i>

65
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

66
00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can survive if you burrow inside.

67
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:54.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But can you really take over
when there's only half of you?

68
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you really win against me
in that damaged body?

69
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

70
00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:03.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's my body!

71
00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't! Stop!

72
00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:07.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's speaking?

73
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it Hikawa?

74
00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or is it Tamura?

75
00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please stop!

76
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm on your side!

77
00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:15.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that's true,
why are you approaching me?

78
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shit! I've lost control
of everything below my neck!

79
00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:19.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give it up!

80
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Die along with that fragment
of Tamura Reiko!

81
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm on your side!

82
00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How dare you! How dare you?

83
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How dare you?

84
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How dare you?

85
00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is your strategy?

86
00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The body you tried to take over
is in shreds!

87
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come out!

88
00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long do you intend to hide in there?

89
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When did youâ€¦

90
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Given that our human bodies
are our weakness,

91
00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you should strike them down in
a single blow without making a show of it.

92
00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:09.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even if our human bodies are destroyed,

93
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
parasite cells continue to survive
for a certain length of time

94
00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:15.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and emit signals,

95
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as you are now experiencing firsthand.

96
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:25.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strongest signals
we emit are animosity

97
00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and our intent to kill.

98
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is an important means of distinguishing

99
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whether a parasite
we cannot see but can detect

100
00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is friend or foe.

101
00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:40.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, you decimated Hikawa's body
despite her being an ally

102
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:45.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and consequently spread fragments
of flesh emanating animosity around you.

103
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

104
00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those fragments acted as camouflage

105
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and masked my signal as I approached you.

106
00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impossible.

107
00:08:57.286 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even that was part of your plan?

108
00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:04.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where have we come from?

236
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:22.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
