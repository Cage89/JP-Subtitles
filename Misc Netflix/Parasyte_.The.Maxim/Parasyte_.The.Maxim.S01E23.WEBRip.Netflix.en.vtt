106
00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:36.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

187
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

195
00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:02.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What fury.

196
00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The underlying source of his anger

197
00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:12.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
does not exist within me,
since I never took control of a brain.

198
00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:16.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is the drive to devour
the human species.

199
00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:23.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That emotion was amassed and amplified

200
00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:26.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
until a bloodthirsty,

201
00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But even that is nowâ€¦

202
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A single cut in the taut rope
being pulled in the struggle

203
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
was enough to make
his entire body explode.

204
00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:51.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Until toxins were lodged deep
within his body,

205
00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:54.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he was one complete organism.

206
00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dominion of his head was absolute,

207
00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:01.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
allowing him to instantaneously put
other parasites to sleep and control them.

208
00:15:01.775 --> 00:15:04.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were you his slave, too?

209
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it was actually very pleasant.

210
00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:10.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Though asleep,

211
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it was as though there was a constant flow
of information streaming through my mind.

212
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it felt wonderful.

213
00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:22.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think I'd mind staying a part of
this invincible life form, Gotou, forever.

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:29.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

216
00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is where you picked up
the stick you stabbed him with?

217
00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but what's this toxin
you're talking about?

218
00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:43.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

219
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am not entirely certain,
but it could've contained hydrogen cyanide

220
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:51.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from the combustion of acrylic products.

221
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's toxic?

222
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lethally so.

223
00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:58.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe they'd just dump
something like that here.

224
00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:01.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

225
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In other words,
no one can win against humans.

226
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shinichi!

227
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go back to where we were!

228
00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is unexpected.

229
00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gotou is trying to revive himself.

230
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

231
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look!

232
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:27.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The earlier explosion
expelled the toxin from his body.

233
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The head's desperately trying
to call the others back together.

234
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:34.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But since they were scattered in such
small fragments, the response is slow.

235
00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:37.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The possibility of regeneration is 50/50.

236
00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:41.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And if he succeeds?

237
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing will change.

238
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He might be somewhat less powerful,

239
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but as long as he stays alive,
he'll want to kill.

240
00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:50.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then, we have to kill him.

241
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:51.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

242
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Migi?

243
00:16:58.851 --> 00:16:59.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I changed my mind.

244
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:04.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From my perspective,
he's one of my own kind,

245
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:06.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
even one I temporarily
shared the same host with.

246
00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:09.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I were to kill him,

247
00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:12.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
from a human perspective,
it'd amount to murder.

248
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:14.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll let you handle it.

249
00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:18.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can finish him, if you use that
cleaver to destroy his exposed organs.

250
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want me to do it?

251
00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:23.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do what you want.

252
00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:26.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don't, we can just run far away
while we have the chance.

253
00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:30.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that would mean more people will die.

254
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right.

255
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:35.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

256
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's kind of pitiful.

257
00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:44.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are fragile.

258
00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:48.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We are merely a life form
that cannot survive on its own.

259
00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:52.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, don't bully us.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:09.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
