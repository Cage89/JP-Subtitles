25
00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

27
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:41.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'll go to sleep.

30
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a different kind of sleep.

31
00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>you can think of it as regaining</i>

35
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

36
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I don't get what you mean!</i>

37
00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My internal structure
has been altered yet again.

38
00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:09.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In particular, my time spent in a lucid
dream of sorts within Gotou's body,

39
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where I felt alone yet not alone,
has been a major factor in that change.

40
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But Migi.</i>

41
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not only did I obtain a massive
amount of information at once

42
00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I also became capable of pursuing
many lines of thought in parallel.

43
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I now want to shut out
all other information for a while

44
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and see what I can accomplish
with the material

45
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I currently have at my disposal.

46
00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:33.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I will stop all surface activity
for the time being.

47
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:36.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What's wrong?</i>

50
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Aren't there still all kinds of things</i>

51
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right.

52
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'll put it this way.

53
00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to try heading in
a different direction.

54
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A direction that's slightly different
from your world.

55
00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I don't understand.</i>

56
00:02:55.258 --> 00:03:00.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shinichi, I want you to think of me
as a dream.

57
00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why I'm saying
goodbye to you in one.

58
00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

59
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:09.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>All the days I spent with you,</i>
<i>all the times we helped each other,</i>

60
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>they weren't a dream!</i>

61
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right.

62
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The horrific events in your vicinity,

63
00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the deaths of many people,
did happen in reality.

64
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Mom!</i>

65
00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:22.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Mom!</i>

66
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Why is Mom here?</i>

67
00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a mental projection you generated
upon hearing me talk about deaths.

68
00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:34.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, so this is how your mother
appears to you in your mind.

69
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What?</i>

70
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What do you mean?</i>

71
00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What's this?</i>

72
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're all very different from how
I perceived them in my mind's eye.

73
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Show how you see me.

74
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

75
00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What do you mean, "huh"?</i>

76
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, so that's that.

77
00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can pretty much only hope to understand
each other on certain points.

78
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even supposing that humans,
who technically share the same structure,

79
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
could exchange souls with each other,

80
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:16.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they would see and hear worlds
far beyond their imagination.

81
00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I should get going.

82
00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to flip the switch.

83
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Wait! How am I supposed to fight</i>
<i>parasites by myself, if they show up?</i>

84
00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll be fine.

85
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should be more wary
of traffic accidents.

86
00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Wait!</i>

87
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>So I can't ever talk to you again?</i>

88
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Forever?</i>

89
00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:52.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Possibly.

90
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But well, it's not like either of us
is going to die anytime soon.

91
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, it's not normal for someone
to talk to his hand, anyway.

92
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

93
00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>How can you spring this on me?</i>

94
00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll have forgotten all about this dream
when you wake up, like usual.

95
00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:19.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like you to have forgotten
about me along with this dream.

96
00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I'm sure you can.

97
00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen, when you wake up in the morning,

98
00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what you'll see is an ordinary right hand.

99
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's how things should be.

100

102
00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:19.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing yet.

212
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The blood's from that broad.

213
00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:25.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, come on.

214
00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:28.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you let her go?

215
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you stupid?

216
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then, what do I need to do?

217
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you'll spare her life,

218
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do anything.

219
00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:43.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is there something you want?

220
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please tell me what it is.

221
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do I want?

222
00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:50.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cops aren't stupid.

223
00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:54.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's only a matter of time
before I'll be hanged.

224
00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:58.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But since I managed to run into you first,

225
00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:03.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I'd ask for an answer
that wouldn't come from a human.

226
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It makes sense when monsters kill humans.

227
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're just feeding themselves.

228
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what about me? What do you think I am?

229
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nah, I think you know the answer already.

230
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:20.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know I'm the true human here.

231
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:25.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are other guys so much better
at keeping themselves in control?

232
00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:29.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's human nature to want to
kill each other, you know?

233
00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:32.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're making a big fuss about nothing

234
00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when they're all bloodthirsty themselves.

235
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:39.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People who don't know who they truly are
bitch at me about what I do,

236
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:44.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I can tell monsters and humans apart
just by looking at them.

237
00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:48.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I know how unnatural</i>
<i>this whole world's become, too.</i>

238
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no need for monsters!

239
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Humans were created
to be cannibals in the first place!

240
00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've been like that
for thousands of years!

241
00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:00.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's because we tried to stop
all of a sudden

242
00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:03.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that our numbers ballooned
into the billions!

243
00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The world's going to burst
if we don't do something!

244
00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:10.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone's a damn liar,
but you're different, right?

245
00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:13.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be honest, like me.

246
00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:16.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you getting at?

247
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't play dumb.

248
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're a mixed breed, aren't you?
You've got monster in you!

249
00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:21.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

250
00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew from the first time
I laid eyes on you.

251
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not in your head, though.

252
00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:30.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's somewhere else in your body.
-Don't…

253
00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:32.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be ridiculous!

254
00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're his girlfriend.

255
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must've seen his body.

256
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:40.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wasn't there some suspicious mark

257
00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:43.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that might've been
where a monster burrowed inside?

258
00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:48.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please.

259
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let her go.

260
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:51.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Answer me!

261
00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm the normal human being, right?

262
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just following my instincts!

263
00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm the one being true to my nature,

264
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but human society is desperate
to keep ignoring me.

265
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just asking you for a favor,

266
00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:08.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
given that you're halfway
between humans and monsters.

267
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Izumi-kun.</i>

268
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:19.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Halfway between humans and parasites, huh?

269
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Someone said something similar
to me before.

270
00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:31.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Compared to Gotou, you're spun glass,

271
00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:34.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm not that strong anymore.

272
00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If words are all you want,
I'll say anything.

273
00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:41.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, just let her go.

274
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, you're right!

275
00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like you said, I'm--

276
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun!

277
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Call the police.

278
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't need to listen to this jerk.

279
00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:59.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How can he be considered
a normal human being?

280
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:02.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're even worse than those monsters!

281
00:17:03.772 --> 00:17:06.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were so scared,
you couldn't even talk,

282
00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:08.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and now, look how spunky you are.

283
00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:11.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not scared of you!

284
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:14.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been through much worse at school!

285
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Satomi.

286
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Both Izumi-kun and I have gone through it.

287
00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:23.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right. Izumi-kun,
you were amazing when it all happened.

288
00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:28.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>You carried me and protected me</i>

289
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:31.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Sure, you might not be "normal",</i>

290
00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:32.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>but you're human!</i>

291
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Humans think all life is precious!

292
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're the monster, jerk!

293
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:40.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's enough, Satomi.

294
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:43.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Izumi-kun, just go!

295
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, fine.

296
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go call the cops, kid.

297
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think this girl's going to be more fun.

298
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:56.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll have fun taking this toy apart
while I wait.

299
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:59.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This will probably be
the last fun I ever have.

300
00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:03.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's always more fun
taking apart the spunky ones.

301
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:06.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

303
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was always trying to catch up with you.

304
00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:15.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

305
00:18:15.844 --> 00:18:18.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you kept walking off into worlds
I didn't understand.

306
00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:22.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:26.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with you,

308
00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:31.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it looks like I might've
actually gone too far ahead.
