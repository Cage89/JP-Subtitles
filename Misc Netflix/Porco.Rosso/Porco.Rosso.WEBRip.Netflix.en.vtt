00:28:50.937 --> 00:28:52.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

260
00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:16.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The plane Curtis beat in 1927

00:29:16.796 --> 00:29:20.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.

262
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:47.994 --> 00:29:51.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Fio.

273
00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

274
00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's young, but she's got
something my sons don't.

275
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:23.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've known you a long time,

00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:35.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?

278
00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:37.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Both, actually.

279
00:30:37.877 --> 00:30:39.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

280
00:30:41.548 --> 00:30:44.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a good pilot needs?

281
00:30:46.052 --> 00:30:47.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Experience?

282
00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:49.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Inspiration.

283
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:52.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm glad you didn't say experience.

00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:04.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

287
00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:07.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

288

I can't help being a girl,
but we've got your old blueprints.

289
00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:17.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

292
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:25.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

293
00:31:25.466 --> 00:31:30.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shower's hot. Towels on the rack.
Breakfast at seven. Good night.

294
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:38.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're short, but we're friends.
I'll loan you the rest.

295
00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:13.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
FLEXIBILITY

296
00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good morning. Sleep okay?

297
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:27.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you work all night?

298
00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a rough idea.

299
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:33.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Same wing plan
with a different cross section.

300
00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That should give us five knots.

301
00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:42.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The original plans are amazing.
The old wings were monocoque.

302
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:44.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never seen anything like it.

303
00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:48.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whoever designed this wing
really understood wood.

304
00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:50.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so impressed.

305
00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:55.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They only built one.
They said it was too dangerous to fly.

306
00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:58.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Found it in a warehouse.

307
00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:00.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lucky you.

308
00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:04.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With this wing sweep,
I'm surprised you even get lift.

309
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:10.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takeoffs and landings are tricky.
No one can touch her in the air.

310
00:33:11.197 --> 00:33:15.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sweep the wings half a degree more.

311
00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rest is fine.

312
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you'll let me do it?
Thank you! You won't be sorry.

313
00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:25.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But on one condition.

314
00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:31.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't work all night.
You need sleep to do good work.

315

00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:03.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because they're following me.

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:24.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:47.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't dilute our gas here.
Girls are so stupid.

532
00:55:47.927 --> 00:55:49.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Talk to her, will you?

533
00:55:50.221 --> 00:55:51.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pay him, Fio.

534
00:55:52.265 --> 00:55:56.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then stuff your bigger-than-it-looks
backside in the jump seat.

535
00:55:57.145 --> 00:55:58.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're off.

536
00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:01.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fuel goes on your bill!

537
00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:10.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He wasn't gouging us. It's give and take.

538
00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:16.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's pretty around here,
but everyone's broke.

539
00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:20.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's the island.

540
00:56:41.689 --> 00:56:42.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautiful!

541
00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:01.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a great hideout.

542
00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:06.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Agh! My butt's gone to sleep.

543
00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:21.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't move!

544
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:26.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at you silly idiots.

545
00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:28.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boss! We got him!

546
00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:30.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Watch who you're stepping on!

547
00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:32.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Out of my way!

548
00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:35.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've been waiting, pig.

549
00:57:35.368 --> 00:57:37.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We knew you were coming.

550
00:57:37.162 --> 00:57:39.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got scores to settle.

551
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:43.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at this! He brought a girl!

552
00:57:43.084 --> 00:57:43.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's pretty.

553
00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:48.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shut up! So what?
Women make up half of the world.

554
00:57:48.923 --> 00:57:53.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not just any girl.
She's Piccolo's chief designer.

555
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:57.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This cute little thing?

556
00:57:57.724 --> 00:57:58.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure?

557
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:04.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My plane's a lot better than it was.
She's young but she's good.

558
00:58:06.441 --> 00:58:07.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really, Porco?

559
00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:10.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never lie about planes.

560
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:14.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's here to make sure I pay the bill.

561
00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:19.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're in debt, too? Serves you right!

562
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:24.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bust that plane up so bad,
all he's got left is the loan!

563
00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:28.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're going to take an axe
to the plane I built?

564
00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:32.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A plane as beautiful as that?

565
00:58:33.218 --> 00:58:35.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a long story, miss.

566
00:58:36.638 --> 00:58:39.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll bet!
-Well, you know...

567
00:58:39.432 --> 00:58:42.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you call yourselves pilots?

568
00:58:42.227 --> 00:58:44.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are my shoes?

569
00:58:52.987 --> 00:58:56.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was raised on stories
about seaplane pilots.

570
00:58:57.951 --> 00:59:02.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My grandpa always said
there are no finer people anywhere.

571
00:59:03.414 --> 00:59:07.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Their hearts are washed clean
by the sea and sky.

572
00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they're braver than sailors...

573
00:59:11.631 --> 00:59:14.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and prouder than regular pilots.

574
00:59:16.427 --> 00:59:19.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right. That's us seaplane pilots!

575
00:59:20.598 --> 00:59:25.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most precious thing to them
isn't money or women, it's honor.

576
00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:28.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah! That's right, miss!
-You tell him!

577
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:30.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurray for seaplane pilots!

578
00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Played them like a fiddle.

579
00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:39.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right. We won't take our axes
and bust up the plane you built.

580
00:59:39.867 --> 00:59:43.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But honor won't let us
just walk away, either.

581
00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mince the pig!

582
00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:49.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah! Turn him into a baconburger!

583
00:59:49.669 --> 00:59:51.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be so pigheaded!

584
00:59:51.879 --> 00:59:55.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?

585
00:59:56.134 --> 00:59:58.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need that American to save you?

586
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your mothers would weep.
And tell you to take a bath!

587
01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:07.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Porco's come back to go
one-on-one against Curtis...

588
01:00:07.895 --> 01:00:11.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for the honor
of the seaplane pilots of the Adriatic!

589
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A man without honor or scruples
is nothing. Fight fair!

590
01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:20.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always said
we shouldn't have hired Curtis.

591
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop trying to weasel out.

592
01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do we do, Boss?
-She has a point.

593
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We could lose face here.
Should we talk to Curtis?

594
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:34.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get him to fight the pig again?

595
01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the contract's expired.

596
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is embarrassing!

597
01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:44.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's Curtiss!

598
01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, it's Curtis!

599
01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:51.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I heard you! I don't run and I don't hide!

600
01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:57.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What idiot put a path up there?

601
01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:09.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold this for me.

602
01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you want a return match?

603
01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:23.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun now.

604
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what do you want?

605
01:01:36.734 --> 01:01:38.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautiful!

606
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will you marry me if I win?

607
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm serious.

608
01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:51.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right. But if Porco wins,
you pay his bills.

609
01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, Fio!

610
01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:54.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You keep out of it.

611
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:58.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stay out of it!
-Shut up!

612
01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:02.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Speak now or hold your peace, Fio.

613
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's up to him.

614
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:05.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lot of money.

615
01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:07.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bargain!

616
01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:08.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes or no?

617
01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!

618
01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:13.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good!

619
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:18.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, all of you!
I like this girl's spirit.

620
01:02:19.026 --> 01:02:22.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Mamma Aiutos will sponsor this fight!

621
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Count the Federation in!

622
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See you later, Miss Fio!

623
01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:36.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Morons!

624
01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't forget to show up, pig!

625
01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up and get out of here!

626
01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:45.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See ya!

627
01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:53.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look what you've gone and gotten me into!

628
01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be angry. I know it was stupid.

629
01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fio?

630
01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:09.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got to thank you anyway.

631
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got me an opportunity.

632
01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:16.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks. I guess fate meant
for us to be a team.

633
01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:18.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we're partners?

634
01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My chances are only 50-50.

635
01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:25.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe in you.

636
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:32.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hate that word, but it sounds
different coming from you.

637
01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the matter?
You're not feeling well?

638
01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

696
01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:55.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:39.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gimme!

748
01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:48.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Porco! Get above him!

749
01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:51.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's smart to stay low.

750
01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:53.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's harder to hit.

751
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:02.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry! I've got lots of ammo.

752
01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:22.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A barrel roll. The pig's on his tail!
-A barrel roll?

753
01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:26.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That trick made him
the Ace of the Adriatic!

754
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn!

755
01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now!

756
01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:46.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He didn't shoot!
-Did his gun jam?

757
01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:51.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's not going to shoot
until the very end.

758
01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:52.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

759
01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:56.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pig's not a killer.
The American still has plenty of ammo!

760
01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now! Shoot!

761
01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:01.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He didn't fire. What did I tell you?

762
01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:05.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If he shoots now, he'll hit the American.

763
01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:09.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's going to wait till he can put
two or three rounds into the engine.

764
01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:13.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The damn fool!
This is no time for sportsmanship.

765
01:17:13.545 --> 01:17:14.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Porco...

766
01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:18.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong with you? Shoot!

767
01:17:19.926 --> 01:17:23.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or are your guns jammed? Too bad.

768
01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:30.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here they come!

769
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, fight like a pig!

770
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not this way! No!

771
01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's coming around!

772
01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:47.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get down!

773
01:17:58.548 --> 01:17:59.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go fight somewhere else!

774
01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at those vapor trails!

775
01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:17.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You only see this once in a lifetime!

776
01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so moving!

777
01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:32.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If she doesn't hurry she'll miss it.

778
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She won't come out of her room.

779
01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are we going or not? I want to see it too!

780
01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:53.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>F to Gina. Warn pig.</i>

781
01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Stop fooling around. Air Force is coming.</i>

782
01:18:57.023 --> 01:18:59.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"F"? That's Ferrarin.

783
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time to go!

784
01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:25.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're both really tough.

785
01:19:25.802 --> 01:19:27.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're just getting warmed up.

786
01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:31.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go, Porco!

787
01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You stupid pig!

788
01:19:43.528 --> 01:19:46.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think you can have Fio?

789
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now the pig's got his tail!

790
01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The finale!

791
01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:00.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

792
01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:03.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's jammed.

793
01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're finished!

794
01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:13.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

795
01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:15.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jammed!

796
01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:20.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the matter, out of ammo?

797
01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:23.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's broken. Fio's big butt!

798
01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:29.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No ties in this game!

799
01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:34.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't a western!
What are you going to hit with that?

800
01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:38.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You jerk!

801
01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:44.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's that going to do? Hi-ho Silver!

802
01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:54.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You rotten pig!

803
01:20:56.893 --> 01:20:58.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Missed!

804
01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chicken!

805
01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:01.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

806
01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:03.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

807
01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

808

809

811
01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:21.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

812
01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:25.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, wait for me!

813
01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

814
01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:36.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

815
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

816
01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:45.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go punch a cow!

817
01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

818
01:21:56.828 --> 01:21:58.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

819
01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's dirty!

820
01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:31.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uppercut! Block!

821

823
01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:39.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

824
01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't you go faster?

825
01:22:45.251 --> 01:22:47.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

826
01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

827
01:22:56.596 --> 01:23:00.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

828

836
01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:29.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?

837
01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

848
01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:26.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

849
01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:41.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

850
01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:47.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

852
01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:55.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
