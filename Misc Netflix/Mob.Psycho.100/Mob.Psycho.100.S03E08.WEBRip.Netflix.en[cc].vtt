to Mount Mud Boat.

By the way, uh, why are we here again?

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mob] Oh, uh…

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:11.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Inukawa] There have been a lot
of UFO sightings in this area

5
00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
over the years, and apparently,

6
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they always happen around the same time,
on New Year's Eve.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kijibayashi] Evidently,
it's a phenomenon that occurs

8
00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
every seven years,
and as luck would have it,

9
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the last reported sighting
was seven years ago.

10
00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
According to that article, anyway.

11
00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

14
00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:36.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't start puking
when we're almost there.

15
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saruta] This road sure is something.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Reigen] There's supposed
to be a hiking trail near here.

17
00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

18
00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just, I'm pretty sure
we passed the sign

19
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the hiking trail a while ago.

20
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Mob] Thank you.
-Are you serious?

21
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you say something earlier?

22
00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:54.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Kijibayashi] I figured
he wanted to get as far as he could

who showed up

30
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The UFO won't come
if we put off negative vibes.

33
00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? You making fun of me?

34
00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:22.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe I actually canceled
my New Year's Eve plans for this.

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:36.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

62
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:45.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

207
00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll always remain
an important experience…

209
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something to hold in your hearts forever.

We worked hard, no denying that.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about the UFO sightings?
Did those turn out to be fake, too?

217
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, apparently all those really happened.

218
00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

219
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, then,
why shouldn't we keep on trying?

220
00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

224
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Inukawa] Let's go for it.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tome] Did you overdo it?

229
00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mob] I-- I'll be okay.

230
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this sucks. It didn't work.

235
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Considering we live in a world
where psychics and telepaths exist,

236
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure we'll be able
to communicate with aliens eventually!

237
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

238
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:12.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Isn't it incredible how many stars

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Someone tell me what to do!

249
00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Inukawa] Uh, you're the one
who wanted to talk to aliens.

250
00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

251
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, isn't that easy
for you to say? [gasps]

252
00:13:49.854 --> 00:13:51.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was quick! Uh. Hey!

255
00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do we have something
I could catch 'em in, like a net?

256
00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Inukawa] What would you even do
after you caught them?

257
00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And besides,
what if you end up making them angry?

258

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

actually look like, huh?

260
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

261
00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

263
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

265
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

268
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:45.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

274
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, think about the germs
they might be carrying.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right now,
with Takenaka as your interpreter,

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
