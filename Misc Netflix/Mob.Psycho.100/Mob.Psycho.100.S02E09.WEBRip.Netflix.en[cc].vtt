131
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

172
00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After that, we realized if we're going

174
00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we need to make sure

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
