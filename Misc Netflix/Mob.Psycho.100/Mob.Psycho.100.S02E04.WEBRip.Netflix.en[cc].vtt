They're from feelings.
Those powers are derived from emotions.

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:54.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the universe is the variety
of feelings they have.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:58.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

happiness, as well as conflict.

[Mogami] You can't use
your psychic abilities anymore.

What I did just then was measure
the power you imagine you have.

I sensed many feelings pulsing within it.

with letting others use you.

do you?

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

deliberately.

I've got another question for you.

431
00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:30.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take two people, one who lives happily
and another living in misery.

432
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:33.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which of these two people
has stronger feelings?

433
00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The answer is the latter.
Negative feelings are inherently stronger.

434
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:41.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The more stress you feel,
the more weight on your shoulders,

435
00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the greater the energy is within you.

436
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

437
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:49.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It means you can become even stronger
than you are now.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just have to change
the way you look at the world a little.
