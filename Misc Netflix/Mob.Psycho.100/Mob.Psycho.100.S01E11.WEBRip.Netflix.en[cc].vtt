I'll be taking them, especially that one.
The kid who's in the uniform.

101
00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll be great friends.

102
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sakurai] I suggest you quit acting
like you're more than a temp trainee.

103
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a bit blunter than the others.

104
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] Come on.
Don't get so worked up.

105
00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're really upset
about your coworkers being defeated?

106
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You guys must get along
better than I thought.

107
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lay off the swordplay, old man.
That was a compliment.

108
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take it easy, Sakurai.

109
00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone at HQ hates one another.
Nothing like the happy family out here.

110
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[scoffs] Kids these days,
they just don't get it.

111

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasps] Hey! You there!
Who the hell are you?

113
00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[lackey 1] Do you think
he's one of the intruders?

114
00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:41.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[lackey 2] Quick, get the others!

115
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, what are all you guys talkin' about?

116
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's goin' on inside?

117
00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[lackey 3] First thing's first,
you suspicious jerk! Tell us who you are!

118
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh. sure, just a sec.

119
00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[lackey 3] Does he have a gun? Careful!

120
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, wouldn't you know it?
I'm completely out of business cards.

121
00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Seriously?
-His business card?

122
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So anyway, back to the matter at hand.

123
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is there something going on
inside that building?

124
00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[lackey 3] Stay back! We have
nothing to say to some weird outsider!

125
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just get outta here!

126
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh. That's kinda strange.

127
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm usually informed
when something happens,

128
00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I haven't heard anything.

129
00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll check again.
-[lackeys mumbling]

130
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What the heck is he talking about?
-Could he mean…

131
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So then, let's get straight
to the point, shall we?

132
00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can everyone here use psychic powers?

133
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How does he know about that?

134
00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[lackey 4]
He's heard about the organization?

135
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry, but I'm gettin' nowhere
with you guys.

136
00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold it right there, you damned intruder!

137
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

138
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get the feeling he might be--

139
00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was thinking the same thing.

140
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let go of me.

141
00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm only here to discuss work matters
with my subordinate.

142
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your what? Wait a sec. You don't mean--

143
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

147
00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the matter?
Are you not feeling well?

148
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, someone help him in.
Surely you guys have a break room.

149
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

150
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He totally exudes superiority.
He's gotta be--

151

155
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ishiguro] What is it?

156
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[lackey] The boss has arrived
on-location from HQ.

159
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said he wouldn't be back
until next month.

160

It's an intruder or an escapee!

170
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

ordered to do something,

179
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that doesn't mean
it's the right thing to do.

[Reigen] Even if you're able to rise
to the top like that,

184
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all you'll see when you look down
is the filth you left in your wake.

what you're trying to do here,

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
