[Mitsuura] Wh… Who are you?
Where did he go? That guy with the sword!

You need to answer our questions first.

407
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now tell me, did you sell Ritsu Kageyama's
personal information to Claw?

408
00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:08.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To Claw? What's that? Ritsu Kageyama?

409
00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:10.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must be mistaken.

410
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one I invited here
was a kid named Shigeo Kageyama.

-It… It can't be!

412
00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:17.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This all started with a misunderstanding,

413
00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and yet they really managed
to awaken Ritsu.

414
00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:24.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sobs] I don't what's going on.
Damn it all!

415
00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:28.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we were finally seeing some
hope in our research, too.

416
00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:30.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like this guy really
doesn't know anything.

417
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

418
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They were kidnapped.
Is all of this my fault?

419
00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:39.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mitsuura] To think
there's a group like that…

420
00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:43.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, so what level of power
did the kids who were kidnapped have?

421
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause I'd like to know exactly
what we're up against here.

422
00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:50.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

428
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:22.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

any more than necessary.
