00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So then Serizawa lost, I take it?
That moron must've gotten sloppy.

226
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Human relationships

It was the president who finally got me
to leave that room. I'm grateful to him.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even so, I don't understand
the need for us to hurt people.

231
00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been too scared to think about it,
so I just didn't.

232
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if my happiness can only come
from someone else's tears,

233
00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then it's not something
I want in the first place.

234
00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you for making me realize that.

235
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, trash will never be
anything more than trash.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

237
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never really counted

238
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bonding with them is an empty

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And at the end of the day,
I am wholly complete while on my own.

240
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You just don't get it.

People need other people in their lives.
And someday, you'll need them, too.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you're going to regret it.

244
00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me help you.
When you need somebody to talk to,

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be there.

246
00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want to be a shoulder
I can lean on? [chuckles]

247
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Save that kind of talk
for the pathetic weaklings of the world.

248
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's something you should know.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:57.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My dad has the ability to give people

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Teruki] Was it really a good idea
to let him go in alone?

271
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never seen my brother openly
call out his authority like that before.

272
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He looked like
he was in pain to me, though.

273
00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's not usually the type
to charge in to a fight.

274
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

275
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At first glance, Mob may look unreliable,
but you can't deny his strength.

276
00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're talking about

277
00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's just one of the qualities
I'm referring to.

279
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

280
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is his ability to tell people
exactly how he feels.

281
00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

than anything else could.

282
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:28.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By expressing those feelings,
Mob's honest nature helps others--

but things are lookin' pretty bad here.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:49.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:52.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is empty and meaningless.
