00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rather than waste my youth
working after school,

102
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have this sneaking suspicion

103
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that there are other things
I should be experiencing in my life.

104
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you're talkin' about! Puberty!

106
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An important phase in one's life.

107
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is there something specific

108
00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Hitchhike across the country?

109
00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I don't have

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

111
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I understand what you're going through,
but there's no need to rush into things.

112
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In my opinion,
the Going-Home Club is what's best.

113
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're goofin' off during the period

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A club's supposed have
five or more members, right?

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

124
00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's only one thing we can do.

125
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

148
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
