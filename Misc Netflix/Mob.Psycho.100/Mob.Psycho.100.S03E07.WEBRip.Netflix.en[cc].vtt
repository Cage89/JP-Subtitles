Yeah. As long as there's
somebody within range

107
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who's capable of receiving
our signal, of course.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kaito] We may not be able
to send out any specific messages,

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that doesn't mean
we can't spread some noise around.

111
00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spread noise?

112
00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Daichi] <i>It's an unsettling vibration</i>

[Kijibayashi] <i>Oh.</i>
<i>Like when your ears are ringing.</i>

114
00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ritsu] <i>So, you can get their attention?</i>

115
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, depending on who that noise
actually gets through to.

116
00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we keep putting it out
persistently enough,

117
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
chances are someone will eventually
try to locate its source.

118
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

119
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's kinda scary.

120
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. But I'm not seeing
how we have any other choice now.

121
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about it, brother?

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As of this moment,
thanks to our special training with Teru,

130
00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if we concentrate, we can communicate
from a distance of three kilometers.

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yeah, the other day,
he telepathically asked me

132
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Mm-hmm.

135

Oof, that's a pretty big drop-off.

137
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our best bet is to have
Kageyama use his powers

138
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd say that would probably
multiply the range two or three times.

Hold on!
The little brother is a psychic, too?

142
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll be better off if Shige does it.

143
00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

144
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll increase the area as much as I can.

145
00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to pay you back, Kageyama.

147
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, let's do it, Kaito.

148
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even I can faintly
make it out at this point.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

178
00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, as it turns out,

179
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they hold club meetings

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

182
00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sounds like a pretty basic aspect

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

184
00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:49.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I figured I might as well hide out in here
and kill a little time, you know?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

given up on all that stuff?

192
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

everyone always says the Telepathy Club

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
