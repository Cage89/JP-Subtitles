Show me!

105
00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:41.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, a goldfish.

106
00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:44.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not a goldfish. It's Ponyo.

107
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo? I want to see!

108
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Promise not to tell?

109
00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:50.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Promise!

110
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There! Cute, isn't she?

111
00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:04.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks fat. My goldfish is much cuter.

112
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:30.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.

113
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give you some more water.

114
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

115
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:08.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You scared me.

116
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:18.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why, how odd. That was Sosuke's voice.

117
00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:24.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he's supposed to be in school.

118
00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:26.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must be hearing things.

119
00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here I am, Yoshie.

120
00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew I heard your voice.

121
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do I have a secret?

122
00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes!
-Bingo!

123
00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:43.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, what color is my secret?

124
00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Red!
-Red!

125
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:49.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good guess.

126
00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did you know?

127
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:53.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Show us.

128
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:55.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

129
00:19:58.197 --> 00:19:59.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, how pretty.

130
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very cute.

131
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her name is Ponyo.

132
00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:05.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She loves ham, and she can do magic.

133
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:10.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.

134
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.

135
00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:20.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then we could run around just like you.

136
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.

137
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I have a look?

138
00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, Toki.

139
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heavens, it has a face!

140
00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:37.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quickly, throw it back in the sea,

141
00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:39.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
otherwise there'll be a tsunami!

142
00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:42.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're so superstitious, Toki.

143
00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:45.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fish like that bring bad luck.

144
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone knows that!

145
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The tsunami! It's here!

146
00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The tsunami's here!

147
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:58.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tsunami!

148
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong, Toki?

149
00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:06.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just look at my clothes.

150
00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke!

151
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke!

152
00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:26.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke!

153
00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke!

154
00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come back here, and apologize to Toki!

155
00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:46.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

156
00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:49.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke.

157
00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:54.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke.

158
00:21:58.817 --> 00:21:59.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

159
00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:04.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo. Sosuke.

160
00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:08.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo... loves... Sosuke!

161
00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:16.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love you too.

162
00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:19.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

163
00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:01.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

164
00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:05.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

165
00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:12.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

166
00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:15.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke!

167
00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:18.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

168
00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:22.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

169
00:24:21.042 --> 00:24:24.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen, Sosuke. Maybe it was fate.

170
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:26.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't change fate.

171
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo was born in the sea.

172
00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:31.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She went back home, that's all.

173
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:35.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy's gone.

174
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me a lick?

175
00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:40.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurry, it's melting!

176
00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:45.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not bad!

177
00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:53.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cheer up. Koichi will be home tonight.

178
00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:57.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He'll be disappointed
if you're feeling down.

179
00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:26.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No more going in the ocean today, okay?

180
00:25:26.107 --> 00:25:26.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

181
00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:54.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

182
00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time to come inside.

183
00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:02.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think this bucket
will help Ponyo find us?

184
00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:05.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's only one way to find out.

185
00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:23.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.

186
00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:27.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

193

195
00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:49.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fine! Just leave your wife

196
00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Sosuke, let's go out to eat tonight.

198
00:27:00.744 --> 00:27:02.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

There he is! Turn off the lights, Lisa.

200
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:03.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Sosuke! He's a genius.

201
00:28:03.264 --> 00:28:04.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

260
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:18.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

265
00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:41.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It might disrupt the balance of nature.

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll have to fix it later.

272
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't let any creatures in,
or there'll be big trouble.

273
00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

285
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:31.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

286

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

326
00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:44.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's yours, Toki.

327
00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:51.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all wrinkled. What is it?

328
00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:53.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like this.

329
00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:57.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know! It's a grasshopper.

330
00:42:57.533 --> 00:42:59.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's a ship.

331
00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:02.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's your father's ship, isn't it?

332
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:03.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

333
00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:05.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still looks like a grasshopper.

334
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:10.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're leaving, Sosuke.

335
00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:11.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

336

Goodbye, everybody.

337

Goodbye.

338
00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:19.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't let the wind blow you away!

339
00:43:21.056 --> 00:43:22.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

340
00:43:27.313 --> 00:43:28.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The phone lines are down too.

341
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:54.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sea's swelling up!

342
00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:00.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will the ships sink?

343
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're safe out at sea.

344
00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

345
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

346
00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:21.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fasten your seat belt!

347
00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:25.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
THE 12TH OHAMA

348
00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to turn back, Lisa!

349
00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:37.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
People are going to the shelters.

350
00:44:37.299 --> 00:44:41.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there are people

351
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:45.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.

352
00:44:46.558 --> 00:44:48.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just got to get home.

353
00:44:49.603 --> 00:44:51.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No way through here.

354
00:44:54.983 --> 00:44:56.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

355
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No! Stop!

356
00:45:07.287 --> 00:45:08.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here it comes!

357
00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:10.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Run for it, Lisa!

358
00:45:50.789 --> 00:45:52.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fish are following us.

359
00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seat belt, Sosuke!

360
00:46:07.556 --> 00:46:09.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold on tight!

361
00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:02.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That wave's unstoppable!

362
00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:15.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A little girl fell in.

363
00:47:15.874 --> 00:47:17.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was riding a fish.

364
00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:23.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where?

365
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:34.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sea keeps rising.

366
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke, where did you see her?

367
00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Out there, running on top of a fish.

368
00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:40.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On a fish?

369
00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:46.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Sosuke.

370
00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:06.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hang on, Sosuke. We're almost home.

371
00:49:00.812 --> 00:49:02.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a little girl!

372
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's dangerous! Better come with us!

373
00:49:05.817 --> 00:49:06.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stay there, Sosuke.

374
00:49:33.345 --> 00:49:35.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke, do you know her?

375
00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:57.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo?

376
00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it's me!

377
00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's Ponyo!

378
00:50:04.584 --> 00:50:08.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

379
00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:21.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm back!

380
00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:43.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, listen, children.

381
00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:46.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No matter how strange everything seems,

382
00:50:47.252 --> 00:50:49.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we have to stay calm.

383
00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:50.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

384
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:51.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, be good.

385
00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:57.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take off your raincoat, Sosuke.

386
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here, Ponyo, you hold the light.

387
00:51:05.437 --> 00:51:07.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll get you something to dry yourself.

388
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:25.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In here, Ponyo!

389
00:51:28.376 --> 00:51:30.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It smells just like you!

390
00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:34.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

391
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gotcha! Let's get you dried off.

392
00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:50.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such pretty red hair.

393
00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:54.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But your clothes are dry.

394
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:58.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

395
00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like this.

396
00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:07.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, who wants some tea?

397
00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:10.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo, help me with the light.

398
00:52:10.669 --> 00:52:11.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coming!

399
00:52:12.504 --> 00:52:14.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if there's any water...

400
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sure!

401
00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:21.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

402
00:52:23.348 --> 00:52:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have a tank outside.

403
00:52:27.602 --> 00:52:29.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about the gas?

404
00:52:29.938 --> 00:52:30.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Presto!

405
00:52:31.439 --> 00:52:33.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All right!
-All right!

406
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:35.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's propane.

407
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, take your seats.

408
00:52:40.782 --> 00:52:41.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay!

409
00:52:42.075 --> 00:52:43.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Over here, Ponyo.

410
00:52:49.875 --> 00:52:51.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sit down, like this.

411
00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:55.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Put your stuff down.

412
00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:00.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need your hands.

413
00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:01.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can use my feet!

414
00:53:05.098 --> 00:53:06.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow!

415
00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:11.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you two doing?

416
00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her feet are like hands.

417
00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go.

418
00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the best!

419
00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That hit the spot.

420
00:54:35.563 --> 00:54:38.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What shall we do now?

421
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want ham.

422
00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:42.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's crazy about ham.

423
00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:46.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then, let's eat.

424
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But first, let's start the generator.

425
00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:53.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.

426
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:57.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Koichi is my father.

427
00:54:57.919 --> 00:54:59.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he an evil magician?

428
00:54:59.754 --> 00:55:00.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, silly.

429
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:02.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's a ship captain.

430
00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:05.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about your father, Ponyo?

431
00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fujimoto! He keeps me prisoner.

432
00:55:10.056 --> 00:55:12.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I ran away.

433
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about your mother?

434
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love my mother!

435
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:21.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's really scary.

436
00:55:22.068 --> 00:55:23.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds like Lisa.

00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:29.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you help me, Ponyo?

438
00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:48.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe the fuel's too old?

439
00:55:49.596 --> 00:55:50.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it clogged up?

440
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:52.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Clogged up.

441
00:55:52.265 --> 00:55:53.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's clogged up there.

442
00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:10.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Success!

443
00:56:11.076 --> 00:56:12.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All bright!

444
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:16.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, Ponyo!

445
00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:36.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Antenna! Antenna!

446
00:56:36.476 --> 00:56:39.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

447
00:56:40.855 --> 00:56:42.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't see a single light.

448
00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:02.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too loud!

449
00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:03.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

450
00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even the radio's out of whack.

451
00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:12.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is JA4-LL, JA4-LL.

452
00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:14.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Do you read me, Koichi?</i>

453
00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Lisa, Sosuke, and Ponyo here.</i>

454
00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>We're all fine.</i>

455
00:57:20.895 --> 00:57:22.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're about to have dinner.

456
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:24.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ham!

457
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:36.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

458
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:54.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not ready yet.

459
00:57:55.013 --> 00:57:56.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It takes three minutes.

460
00:58:11.571 --> 00:58:13.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Close your eyes.

461
00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:15.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not yet.

462
00:58:18.077 --> 00:58:19.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No peeking, Ponyo.

463
00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:25.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, you can look now.

464
00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And... presto!

465
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ham!
-Good for you, Ponyo.

466
00:58:59.327 --> 00:59:01.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo's fallen asleep.

467
00:59:08.628 --> 00:59:11.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo must've come from far away.

468
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:12.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so.

469
00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:31.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, Sosuke. The sea's calmer.

470
00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:34.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that because Ponyo's asleep?

471
00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:35.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look over there.

472
00:59:43.788 --> 00:59:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's moving. Someone's up there.

473
00:59:46.874 --> 00:59:48.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
People from the home?

474
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gone.

475
00:59:56.509 --> 00:59:57.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the peak road.

476
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:03.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke, stay there with Ponyo.

477
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I could get through
on the mountain road.

478
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to the old folks home.

479
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:25.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll go with you too.

480
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stay here with Ponyo.

481
01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:32.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going too. Let's take Ponyo with us.

482
01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going with you!

483
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sosuke, our house is a lighthouse
in the storm.

484
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:45.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It brings light and hope
to those in the dark.

485
01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:47.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, someone has to stay here.

486
01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:52.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lots of things are happening
that I don't understand.

487
01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:57.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But right now, I'm worried about
the residents of the old folks home.

488
01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:02.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just knowing you're here will help me.

489
01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:05.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry. I promise to come back.

490
01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Promise?

491
01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:10.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I promise.

492
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You promised!

493
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:14.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love you, Sosuke.

494
01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see the lights of the town!

495
01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:16.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Finally. Now we can navigate.

496
01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:18.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never seen that town before.

497
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:27.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did the storm blow us to America?

498
01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:46.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not a mountain.

499
01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:48.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that's no harbor.

500
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those are all ships!

501
01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:03.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carried by the wave,
gathered as a mountain here.

502
01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:08.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a ship graveyard. What's going on?

503
01:03:13.706 --> 01:03:15.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've lost power!

504
01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:18.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heave to! Drop the sea anchor!

505
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:19.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aye-aye!

506
01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something's coming!

507
01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:03.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A sea goddess?

508
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're moving!
-We're saved!

509
01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:20.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was her, it was the goddess!

510
01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Protect us from harm...

511
01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Higher, higher...

512
01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:08.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A barrier spell.

513
01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:11.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where did she learn that?

514
01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:32.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good heavens, she's human!

515
01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, watch out! What are you doing?

516
01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:46.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop it, you lot! It's unsafe!

517
01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:51.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop that at once!

518
01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:01.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm simply trying to save your sister.

519
01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's here. She answered my call.

520
01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:48.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fujimoto.

521
01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You came, my beloved.

522
01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:53.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such a beautiful sea.

523
01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Full of magic.

524
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:02.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As if I'm back in the big ocean.

525
01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:04.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's Ponyo, she tasted human blood

526
01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:08.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and plundered all of my elixir.

527
01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo? What a lovely name.

528
01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:20.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all my fault.

529
01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:23.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's totally beyond my control.

530
01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:25.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's complete chaos.

531
01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:28.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She doesn't understand what she's done.

532
01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:34.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now she's human
and run off to a boy's home.

533
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:38.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we don't stop her,
the planet is doomed!

534
01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:50.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! The satellites are falling.

535
01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The earth's gravitational field...

536
01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be still.

537
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:06.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke... That's his name, yes?

538
01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:13.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You love your sister, don't you?

539
01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, dear.
What if Ponyo really became human?

540
01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Use the old magic.

541
01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:28.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Sosuke's love is real,
she'll lose her powers forever.

542
01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:33.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!

543
01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:37.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's where we all came from, dear.

544
01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:41.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he's only five!

545
01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:49.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sleep well, little children.

546
01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:03.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.

775

780
01:32:41.264 --> 01:32:42.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't understand!

781
01:32:48.688 --> 01:32:49.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can make it!

782

01:33:33.482 --> 01:33:34.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now what?

784
01:34:29.705 --> 01:34:30.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lisa!

785
01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:31.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sousuke.

786
01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:32.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo!

787
01:34:38.214 --> 01:34:39.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look over there.

788
01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are we?

789
01:34:51.977 --> 01:34:53.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, you're Sosuke.

790
01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:57.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello. Are you Ponyo's mother?

791
01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:58.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

792
01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:03.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to thank you
for bringing my daughter back to me.

793
01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:09.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ponyo has broken the magic seal
in order to become a human.

794
01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:12.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To become human,

795
01:35:12.623 --> 01:35:17.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she requires a man
that will understand and accept her.

796
01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:22.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

797
01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:23.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

798
01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:27.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She turned into a mermaid
because she tasted your blood.

799
01:35:27.972 --> 01:35:29.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right!

800
01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.

801
01:35:32.768 --> 01:35:34.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that's why she's half-fish, half-human.

802
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:39.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you accept her as she is?

803
01:35:40.192 --> 01:35:45.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll always love Ponyo,
whether she's a fish, a human,

804
01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:46.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or in between.

805
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come, Ponyo.

806
01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:22.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

807
01:36:24.987 --> 01:36:28.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But to become human,
you first must give up your powers.

808
01:36:29.325 --> 01:36:30.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you do that?

809
01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

810
01:36:41.212 --> 01:36:44.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kiss this bubble when you return to land,

811
01:36:45.174 --> 01:36:49.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and Ponyo will transform
into a little five-year-old girl.

812
01:36:52.264 --> 01:36:54.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's wonderful, Ponyo.

813
01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:57.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

814
01:37:03.776 --> 01:37:07.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now the planet is safe again.

815
01:37:10.866 --> 01:37:14.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Splendid, Sosuke!

816
01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke!

817
01:37:18.832 --> 01:37:20.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sosuke!

818
01:37:44.483 --> 01:37:46.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm grateful, Lisa.

819
01:37:46.735 --> 01:37:49.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

820
01:38:00.874 --> 01:38:03.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is everyone all right?

821
01:38:08.924 --> 01:38:11.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

822
01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:13.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't bother, we'll walk.

823
01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:15.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all so exciting.

824
01:38:19.184 --> 01:38:20.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe this boat is yours.

825
01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:24.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

826
01:38:24.982 --> 01:38:28.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope you'll forgive me. May I?

827
01:38:34.658 --> 01:38:35.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take good care of Ponyo.

828
01:38:39.038 --> 01:38:40.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's Koichi's boat.

829
01:38:45.044 --> 01:38:46.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
