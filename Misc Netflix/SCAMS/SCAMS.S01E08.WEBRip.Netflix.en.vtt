00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:16.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dokugawa-san, what did Kurusu do?

17
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That punk was working with the robbers!

21
00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:32.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When things go wrong,
shouldn't the financiers share the loss?

22
00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nine million yen by this weekend.

26
00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this the Kurusu home?

27
00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this the Kurusu home?

29
00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What makes you think anyone lives here?

30
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe he's here
to redeliver a package we missed.

31
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah. They do that in the city!

32
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's definitely it.

33
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not a delivery man!

34
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what's he here for?

35
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

36
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It hurts!

37
00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dokugawa-san?

38
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

39
00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I took care of it.

40
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

41
00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got it.

42
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
EPISODE 8

43
00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't tell you,

44
00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but we were robbed a while back.

45
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our financiers suspected us,
so we set a trap.

46
00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Soon after that,
we caught one of the crooks.

47
00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We roughed him up, then he named--

48
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kurusu.

49
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:44.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won't forgive him.

50
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is Kurusu?

51
00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He ran away.

52
00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

53
00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

54
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was waiting for you.

55
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were waiting for... what?

56
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go find him!

57
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're paying you a lot for this!

58
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're giving me less than market price--
-Go!

59
00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go! Go after him! Run!

60
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said run!

61
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, I heard from that Shiro guy

62
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you were the ones who were
robbing those old folks' homes.

63
00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were you working with anyone else?

64
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell me!

65
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you want to know...

66
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-then stop kicking me--
-What?

67
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's make a deal!
-What?

68
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Smart thinking, Toki!

69
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beat him in a battle of wits!

70
00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A battle of wits?

71
00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must be a pretty smart guy!

72
00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do this until you talk!

73
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll talk!

74
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll talk!

75
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seimiya!

76
00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?

78

Yes, we just got back.

79
00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seimiya?

80

84
00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well... Seimiya is...

85
00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not here.

86
00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What?</i>

87
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Find him, you idiot!

88
00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:19.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kusano!

89
00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you working with Seimiya?

90
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not.

91
00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you were meeting secretly!

92
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You thought you were being so sneaky, huh?

93
00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were just drinking together.

94
00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had nothing to do with the robberies.

95
00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what about your secret register?

96
00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:42.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How did you know?
-So it's true. Your profits were too good.

97
00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was bluffing.

98
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll hear all about it
after we're done with this.

99
00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't even think about running away.

100
00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:01.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

101
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here? Which room?

102
00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-201!

103
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He came back and packed his things.

104
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He should still be close by.

105
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:26.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

106
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit!

107
00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why won't you pick up?

108
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit!

109
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pick up!

110
00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit!

111
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kusano...

112
00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:55.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you do?

113
00:08:56.577 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What did you do?
-It's not what you think!

114
00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up! You're coming with me.

115
00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:02.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! They'll kill me!

116
00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:04.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They suspect me now, too.

117
00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't mean for this to happen!

118
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:12.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you I borrowed a lot of money
a long time ago, right?

119
00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was hiding from them,
but they finally found me!

120
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They told me
if I didn't pay it back right away,

121
00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they'd go after my family!

122
00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:25.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had to do something!

123
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was desperate!

124
00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could've paid it back
with the money from scamming,

125
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but then you said you'd quit!

126
00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:38.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think
I could keep going without you!

127
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I panicked,

128
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I knew one of the guys
who was collecting money for us.

129
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And so...

130
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So you organized the robbery?
-That's right!

131
00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:58.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told Kurusu I needed help.

132
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

133
00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:05.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you say anything to me?

134
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How could I?

135
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said you wanted to go back
to having a normal life.

136
00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't want to trouble you!

137
00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There he is! Seimiya!

138
00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You bastard!

139
00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:30.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you do?

140
00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey! Stop!

141
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get off of me!

142
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

143
00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

144
00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

145
00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please! Please!

146
00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:52.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry!

147
00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please! I don't want to die!

148
00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me see them one more time!

149
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a terrible person!

150
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's so much I want to apologize for!

151
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, I'll do anything!

152
00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do anything!

153
00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dokugawa called me.

154
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He said they got Kurusu.

155
00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What... will happen to us?

156
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:19.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're meeting
with the financiers tomorrow.

157
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It won't be good.

158
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:23.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Also...

159
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I heard you were hiding
something from us, Kusano.

160
00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I already threw the register away.

161
00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have the original data, right?

162
00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:37.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll give it to our higher-ups
as an apology.

163
00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just sent someone to your house.

164
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:40.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My house?

165
00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wait, I can bring--
-It's too late!

166
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our reputation has been completely ruined.

167
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:52.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tojo is going to cut off one
or both of my arms for this.

168
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The debt we owe is worth
more than both of your lives.

169
00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:00.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's too late.

170
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's too late for all of us!

171
00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kanbe-san!

172
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:07.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kanbe-san!

173
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kusano had nothing to do with this!

174
00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:14.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did it all myself! He had no idea!

175
00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all my fault!

176
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's my fault!

177
00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:22.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So please spare him!

178
00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please!

179
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:27.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please!

180
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please!

181
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:31.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please!

182
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please!

183
00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:35.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please!

184
00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:36.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please...

185
00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:39.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please...

186
00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:01.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dokugawa and I...

187
00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
were players just like you guys once.

188
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:12.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We planned to make money
and quit right away,

189
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it just kept dragging on.

190
00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:25.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get lost.

191
00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:32.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go.

192
00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should be safe now.

193
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:02.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kusano...

194
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what are you going to do?

195
00:15:07.197 --> 00:15:08.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to go home.

196
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:13.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will you be okay on your own?

197
00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:16.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

198
00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:21.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should go to your family, too.

199
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:24.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bet they've been waiting a long time.

200
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be careful.

201
00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You, too.

202
00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:22.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here we are.

203
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks a lot, Misaki-chan.
-My pleasure.

204
00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:30.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll make some tea.
-Okay.

205
00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if Makoto's home.

206
00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The lights were on in his room.
-Were they?

207
00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makoto?

208
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're home!

209
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makoto?

210
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take that laptop.

211
00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:40.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you...

212
00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:41.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give that back!

213
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:43.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give it back!

214
00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:44.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Give it back!
-Hand it over, old lady!

215
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait! Don't hurt her!

216
00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:47.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop!

217
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:48.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop it!

218
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
