Since 2003, a special
type of scam targeting the elderly

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
called the money transfer scam
has proliferated in Japan.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Financial damages increased every year,
reaching 56.5 billion yen in 2014.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, in 2019,
scammers have changed their techniques,

5
00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:33.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the damage continues.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it that bad?

8
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the houses I work at
was being robbed.

9
00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There were three of them,

10
00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and one of them asked the old man
to come outside

11
00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.953 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
while the others looked for money.

12
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's when I arrived.

13
00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:23.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They hit you?

14
00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told them I didn't know
where the money was.

15
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn them.

16
00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:36.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was a punishment.

17
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:38.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For?

18
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Punishment for scamming others.

19
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be silly!

20
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If anyone were to be punished, it's me.

21
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I put that house on the register.

22
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maybe one of your friends--
-That's impossible!

23
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.373 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a coincidence.

24
00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:43.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on!

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Let's try from this side now.

28
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

29
00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

30
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

31
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

32
00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So? What's the emergency?

33
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

35
00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I saw this on the news.

36
00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bunch of old people's homes
were robbed, right?

37
00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three in one week.

38
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All of these victims
are on the M register.

39
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

40
00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Someone's leaking information?
-Maybe.

41
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a huge problem!

42
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where does the M register even come from?

43
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want you to tell me!

44
00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't tell anyone.
-Of course not.

45
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My mom's a homecare worker,
and she collected this data for me.

46
00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

47
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She got caught up in a robbery
and was badly injured.

48
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think it's one of our guys?

49
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who leaked it?

50
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want to doubt them, but...

51
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll stop using the M register.

52
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If... And this is hypothetical,

53
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:22.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but if one of us leaked the info,
who is it?

54
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not you, right?

55
00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, sorry.

56
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That leaves Gouriki...

57
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mori...

58
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Kurusu.

59
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kusano, why did you
get rid of the M register?

60
00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were doing so good.

61
00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just like you said, we shouldn't do
anything to make Dokugawa-san angry.

62
00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At this rate,
we can hit our goal without it.

63
00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no reason to take risks.

64
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And is the money collector problem
taken care of?

65
00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kanbe-san figured something out.

66
00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good to hear.

67
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry for before.

68
00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:17.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How are your friends?
-Friends?

69
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cavemen?

70
00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said I'm sorry.

71
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't talked to them since.

72
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's absolutely terrible.

109
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here.

110
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:38.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, this is it?
-Wait!

111
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were we seen by anyone?

112
00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like who?

113
00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:44.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If Dokugawa-san finds out, we're screwed.

114
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's too busy for that.

115
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come in.
-Yeah.

116
00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't mind the mess.

117
00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You okay with tap water?
-Sure.

118
00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:08.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can I sit down?
-Sure.

119
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

120
00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:15.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I took on a lot of debt
back when I worked in the water business.

121
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I used to sell water coolers.

122
00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:21.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After that, I swore
to never again buy water.

123
00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

124
00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:27.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll get the water.
-Thanks.

125
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Here we go.
-Do you want more?

126
00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:34.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, a little.
-A little.

127
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

128
00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

129
00:09:46.627 --> 00:09:48.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes like tap water.

130
00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tap water is good.

131
00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:52.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is rare for you, right?

132
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I only drink tap water.
-Why?

133
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just buy fresh water.

134
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, what's up?
-Well...

135
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're going to hit our goal soon.

136
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep.

137
00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:14.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we succeed, then...

138
00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm thinking of quitting.

139
00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:21.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quit?

140
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know it's selfish.

141
00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I promised my mom,

142
00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and I never planned to--
-Hold on.

143
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What'll happen to me?

144
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We could quit together.

145
00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:39.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then we could look for a new job together
or something.

146
00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're joking.

147
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no jobs that'll accept both

148
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a college graduate
and middle school graduate.

149
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-If we look, maybe--
-There aren't any!

150
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even if there were,

151
00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you'd abandon me in a second.

152
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get it.

153
00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're okay with being my friend now,

154
00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that's just because of the job, right?

155
00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not!

156
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, now you're going to abandon me.

157
00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:11.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really thought you and I
would make it to the top.

158
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, well...

159
00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm just scared.
-Of what?

160
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of getting caught?

161
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

162
00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That'll hurt your perfect career.
-It's not that.

163
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:37.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've started to...

164
00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:39.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
enjoy this job.

165
00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm scared of my own feelings.

166
00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:48.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't act like a smart-ass...

167
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
after all this.

168
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

169
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
THE CON ARTISTS
VOL. 14

170
00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:55.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got it.

171
00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, stop it!

172
00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:26.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hot!

173
00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You done?

174
00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We got the money!

175
00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Money!

176
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have some, Shiro.
-What is this?

177
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's corn soup.

178
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's hot.
-It is!

179
00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:47.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

180
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were robbed of nine million yen.

181
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What will you do about this?

182
00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:57.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing.

183
00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:04.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When we fail to collect, we just give up
as if nothing happened. That's our rule.

184
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we make it one man's fault,

185
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he ends up going to the police,
then we're all done for.

186
00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:15.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's beautiful.
Thank you for the lesson, Kanbe!

187
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about our injured man?

188
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll send him compensation. That's it.

189
00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:22.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not it!

190
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This guy is a reliable
and seasoned professional.

191
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And as soon as he does a job for you,
he gets jumped?

192
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you saying my men are involved?

193
00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

194
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Impossible.
-Of course it's not!

195
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's impossible.

196
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My men can make more money

197
00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:44.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
by simply working hard.

198
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's safer for them.

199
00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:51.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. Thank you for another great lesson.

200
00:14:57.104 --> 00:15:01.358 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quit patting yourself on the back
and bring your men here, or I'll kill you!

201
00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I trust them.

202
00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your store is being attacked.

203
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your money was stolen.

204
00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your own man was beaten up.

205
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should you do?

206
00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's your job?
You're the leader. Show some dignity!

207
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:28.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bring me my nine million yen!

208
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:34.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got it? Nine million by the weekend.

209
00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:38.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In this business, when things go wrong,

210
00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:41.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
shouldn't the financiers share the loss?

211
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nine million by the weekend.

212
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:48.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the fact that we were robbed
as soon as we got a new collector

213
00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
shines the light of doubt on you!

214
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:52.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kanbe...

215
00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
do you really want to mess with me?

216
00:15:57.581 --> 00:15:58.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want a war?

217
00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A war would be bad.

218
00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But...

219
00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right, Kanbe-san.

220
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:13.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you went along with him,
he'd get cocky and rob us again.

221
00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:18.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At any rate, things have fallen apart.

222
00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nine million probably won't fix it.

223
00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:26.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give up whatever you need me to,

224
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:28.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-whether it's money or a finger.
-A finger?

225
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:32.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're not the yakuza.
-I'm serious.

226
00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:35.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the leader's job
to take responsibility when this happens.

227
00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:43.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know...

228
00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:49.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had the most fun when I was a player.

229
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Working with you.

230
00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We went to the beach together.

231
00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:59.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. We did.

232
00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:03.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rules were less rigid then.

233
00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:08.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We drank, had barbeques together.

234
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And there was that guy
who smashed a Jet Ski into a rock.

235
00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:18.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was his name?

236
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's best when it's extra crispy.

237
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right?

238
00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:34.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no doubt about it. None at all.

239
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you can't end there.

240
00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about the foundations.

241
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is it better crispy?

242
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:45.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In order to solve that,
think back to your childhood.

243
00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:48.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think about your foundations.

244
00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:52.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you were little, you'd scrape
your knees and develop scabs, right?

245
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you'd pull them off and eat them.

246
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you get it?

247
00:17:57.993 --> 00:17:59.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You get it, right?

248
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crispy scabs.

249
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:06.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the reason
people like crispy things.

250
00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Things that are just a little wet.

251
00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's because they ate scabs.

252
00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:13.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why.

253
00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:16.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right?

254
00:18:28.398 --> 00:18:31.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello? Dokugawa-san?

255
00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:33.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

256
00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:37.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take care of it.

257
00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got it. Bye.

258
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for the interruption.

259
00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Scams are on the rise.</i>

260
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got that? Send the money right away!

261
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:55.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Otherwise, I'll come to your house!

262
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you hear me?

263
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We got it! Five million yen!

264
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes!
-Yeah!

265
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:04.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we collect this,
we'll reach our target!

266
00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:05.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

267
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:09.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Incredible! Let's have a drink!

268
00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll go get some beer.

269
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Idiot, alcohol's not allowed.
-We'll take shots of water.

270
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're killing me!

271
00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:18.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dokugawa-san? It's me, Kusano.

272
00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:22.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please send someone to take
five million from our sixth account.

273
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

274
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:24.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

275
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

276
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just do it.

277
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:33.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Let's go out after this.

278
00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:36.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It should be fine, right?
-I think so.

279
00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:40.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you not to call my work phone!

280
00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If something happens, I'll call you.

281
00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:44.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

282
00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:45.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

283
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll check later.

284
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should only use that for work.

285
00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:54.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatever you say.

286
00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Seimiya.

287
00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I...
-You're leaving soon, huh?

288
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:21.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Give us the money.

290
00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:30.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

291
00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:36.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

292
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All this money!

297
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:01.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
