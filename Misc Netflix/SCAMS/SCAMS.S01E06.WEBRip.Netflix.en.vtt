Since 2003, a special
type of scam targeting the elderly

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
called the money transfer scam
has proliferated in Japan.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Financial damages increased every year,
reaching 56.5 billion yen in 2014.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, in 2019,
scammers have changed their techniques,

5
00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:33.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the damage continues.

7
00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That's right. No matter what happens...</i>

8
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom?

10
00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makoto. Explain this.

11
00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you see,

12
00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
my work is kind of special, so...

13
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. Why were you searching my room?

14
00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I went through your computer, too.

15
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What? How?
-Your password is your birthday, right?

16
00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:49.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't believe it. It's filled
with plans for scamming people.

17
00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you paid for your dad's treatment
and your student loans

18
00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with the money you stole from the elderly?

19
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

20
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I had a regular job,
I'd be used like a slave

21
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and make virtually nothing.

22
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I'm rich,

23
00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
thanks to scamming.

24
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you going to do now?

25
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I plan to quit...

26
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:25.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Plan to"?

27
00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm in charge of something big now.
I have to finish that first.

28
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't get out now?

29
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't a game.
If I quit now, they'll kill me!

30
00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's go to the police.
-The police?

31
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't. They'd kill all of us.

32
00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't, no matter what.
I can't turn myself in--

33
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Calm down!

34
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The truth is, I heard
that you were acting strange

35
00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from Misaki-chan.

36
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Misaki?

37
00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought about a lot of things
while I was waiting for you.

38
00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"What would your dad say?"
Things like that.

39
00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:14.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When will you finish that "big job"?

40
00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:16.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

41
00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm asking you about your job situation.

42
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

43
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our goal is really high,
so I'm not sure if we'll reach it...

44
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if everything goes well,
I think I can ask about quitting.

45
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd also make a ton of money,

46
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we'd be all right for a while
even after I quit.

47
00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How much?

48
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Around ten million yen.

49
00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine.

50
00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I can help.

51
00:03:59.113 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

52
00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're going to reach your goal
and then cut ties with those people?

53
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Respond!

54
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He gave money to a young guy
who came to his house.

108
00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's unbelievable!

109
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To think he had millions in cash.

110
00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The elderly are rich nowadays.

111
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why'd he hand it over, I wonder?

112
00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'd think he'd know better.

113
00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:54.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The M register was more effective</i>
<i>than I ever imagined.</i>

114
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel bad for him. Kind of.

115
00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:01.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Understood. We'll send
one of our people to your house.

116
00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

117
00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please have the money on hand, in cash.

118
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

119
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

120
00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:15.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is crazy.

121
00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, Dokugawa-san?

122
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got another hit.
Can you send the money collectors?

123
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hey. Do you have a moment to meet up?</i>

124
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure. And the money collectors?

125
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I'll drive over now. I'll be there in ten.</i>

126
00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is it? What's wrong?

127
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nothing.

128
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:41.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm stepping out for a sec.

129
00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't collect?

130
00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yamada disappeared, and now
we don't have enough money collectors.

131
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even if we fool our targets,

132
00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there's no one to go collect
or take out the money.

133
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are stores that have lost
up to 20 million yen.

134
00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That much?

135
00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:26.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seimiya's hit just now was also a bust.

136
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

137
00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing we can do!

138
00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:32.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't tell the others about this.

139
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'll ruin their motivation.

140
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what happens to our profits?

141
00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In situations like this,
the leader has to fill in the gaps.

142
00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Kanbe-san will pay himself?

143
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:44.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the rule.

144
00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:50.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kanbe-san is talking to our financiers
about what needs to be done.

145
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:55.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Until you receive orders,
hold off on going after big targets.

146
00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go after small and new targets.

147
00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got it?

148
00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

149
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, okay.

150
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry. I'll introduce you
to some money collectors.

151
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

152
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, call Tecchan.

153
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right away.

154
00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:23.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take care of it.

155
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you for your consideration.
However...

156
00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:30.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I know someone
who might be good.

157
00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They can be trusted.

158
00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait a moment.

159
00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you saying you can't trust my people?

160
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Of course not--
-Why?

161
00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:44.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it because I'm yakuza?
You don't trust the yakuza?

162
00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:48.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Minegishi, what do you think?

163
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:52.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It seems to me he's wary of you.

164
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wary of me?
Why would Kanbe-chan be wary of me?

165
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If he trusts people employed by the yakuza

166
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they run off with his money,
he'll have nothing.

167
00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what he thinks.

168
00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:07.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kanbe-chan,
how dare you think such things?

169
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's not it!
-It'd better not be!

170
00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kanbe-chan, you don't have
any other plans today, right?

171
00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go get something to eat.

172
00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Thank you.

173
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll get yakiniku.

174
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see...

175
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:35.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No money collectors...

176
00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't tell the others.

177
00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:38.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure...

178
00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Kanbe-san can't cover
the losses forever.

179
00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is bad.

180
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're trying to solve it, though.

181
00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:49.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine as long as we're paid,

182
00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:53.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but if that's delayed,
everyone's motivation will disappear.

183
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah...

184
00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But thanks for telling me.

185
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll slow down my pace for now.

186
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kurusu.

187
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I heard everything.

188
00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, don't tell--
-I got it.

189
00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:17.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won't tell.
But this is pretty bad, isn't it?

190
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:21.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you're willing, I have a proposal...

191
00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:23.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Proposal?

192
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

193
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That register is really helping.

194
00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:57.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's super effective. Everyone is amazed.

195
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you always feel like this?

196
00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

197
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:05.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel nauseous all the time.

198
00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:10.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Makoto, have you been living like this
all this time?

199
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At first.

200
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But now I don't feel anything.

201
00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my job.

202
00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shall I get you some medicine?

203
00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:32.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm fine. I'm just a little anxious.

204
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:38.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought I had made up my mind.

206
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dinner is in the fridge.

207
00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

208
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey.
-Hey.

209
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:13.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aren't you working today?
-I'm off.

210
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? What's up?

211
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey...

212
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did Sachiko-chan say anything to you?

213
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:26.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say anything? Like what?

214
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:28.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She didn't ask?

215
00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:32.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
About you doing some scary type of work
or anything?

216
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah. Himeka said something, right?

217
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was lying.

218
00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Himeka was really scared.

219
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:42.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really?

220
00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:45.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makoto!

221
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not lying.

222
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm glad.

223
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was worried.

224
00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:30.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This way.
-Okay.

225
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

226
00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:49.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

227

Hey!

228
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:53.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I brought him.

229
00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is Taiga, and that's Shiro.

230
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:02.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I met them when I worked
at an escort agency.

231
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

232
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is great!

233
00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's my boss!

234
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:10.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

235
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:12.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

236
00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:17.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Taiga.

237
00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:20.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Taiga!

238
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Taiga!

239
00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get yourself together, we have a guest!

240
00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:29.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good afternoon.

241
00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, you want some hot pot?

242
00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:37.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We got the cabbage from a field nearby.

243
00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:40.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fresh and good.

244
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:44.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Idiot! That's Kuru-chan's boss,
did you hear?

245
00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's an important guy!

246
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't just offer him weed.

247
00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:52.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some live seafood will be here soon.

248
00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

249
00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There he is!

250
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're huge!

251
00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:06.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at them move!

252
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It got my finger!

253
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:11.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It got me again!

254
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello there. My name is Toki.

255
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:20.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got these guys
from the sewer over there.

256
00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:21.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please have some.

257
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, please have some.

258
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is where they live.
You can tell they're tough.

259
00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:32.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were arrested recently, right?

260
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was rough.

261
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:37.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told the dude to hit me again.

262
00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he was like...

263
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:42.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"You want to go again? Really?"

264
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what he said to me!

265
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want to get promoted to the top!

266
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah!

267
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:53.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've got spirit, right?

268
00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:54.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right?

269
00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you pay us, we'll do whatever you want.

270
00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The old people in Tokyo

271
00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:03.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-have tons of money, right?
-They're loaded!

272
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For a 100 million...

273
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:09.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One hundred million?

274
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:12.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would commit murder, burn down houses.

275
00:18:12.966 --> 00:18:14.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all the same to me!

276
00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:18.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all the same!

277
00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:25.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on.

278
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:27.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

279
00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:31.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way.

280
00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:33.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

281
00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:36.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They'd make perfect collectors.
-It's too dangerous.

282
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're crazy.
-What?

283
00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're perfect!

284
00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're like cavemen.

285
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't introduce them to our superiors.
I'm going home.

286
00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:48.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait.

287
00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:53.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apologize.

288
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:55.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

289
00:18:57.261 --> 00:19:00.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't talk down to my friends. Apologize!

290
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No...

291
00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:06.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't mean to...

292
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:11.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

293
00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:17.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm...

294
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
sorry.

295
00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Kusano...

296
00:19:26.373 --> 00:19:30.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't stand how you act
like you're better than everyone.

297
00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:33.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you went to college?

298
00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You worked at a real job?

299
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what it is,

300
00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I just can't stand you.

301
00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:49.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you keep acting all high and mighty,
you might get stabbed in the back.

302
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:52.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stabbed?

303
00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

304
00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:59.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By who?

305
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"By who"?

306
00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:13.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was hypothetical.
Don't take it so seriously.

307
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:18.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They got together on their day off for us.

308
00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They'll be pissed
if we don't accept their hospitality.

309
00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on.

310
00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:28.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on!

311
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:31.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, guys.

312
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let him try some of that.

313
00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:36.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's good, right?

314
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let him eat!

315
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Good morning.

316
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Good morning.

317
00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:06.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This sucks.

318
00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:07.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's the money?

319
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kuru-chan is going to get mad at us again.

320
00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:14.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is really scary when he gets mad.

321
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello!

322
00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:20.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's Sachiko from the home helper service.

323
00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello?

324
00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:25.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yabe-san?

325
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How are you doing?

326
00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:32.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yabe-san?

327
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:36.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
