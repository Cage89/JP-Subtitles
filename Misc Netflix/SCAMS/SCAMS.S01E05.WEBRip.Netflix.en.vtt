00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Thanks for making it out here,

20
00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:50.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you trying to achieve
by doing this?

21
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You wanna rat me out to Kanbe?

22
00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't you at least hear me out?

23
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you do, you might just have
a change of heart.

24
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hear you out? About what?

25
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to rob you!

26
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, to be precise,
we're going after Kanbe.

27
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's opened up nine stores now, right?

28
00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we do this right,
the payoff will be unbelievable.

29
00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want information!

30
00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Information?

31
00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:39.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't been able to find
any of his weaknesses yet.

32
00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, you'd get a cut as well.

33
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How about ten percent?

34
00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a good deal, right?

35
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me a high five!

36
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It hurts!

37
00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It hurts!

38
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on now.

39
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, this is
your little punk friend's fault.

40
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, but...

41
00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you've left me without a choice!

42
00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Go ahead and do it.
-What?

43
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're going to fail. Mark my words.

44
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You little...
-How dare you!

45
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, wait, wait!

46
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've piqued my interest.

47
00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What exactly do you mean by that?

48
00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it obvious?

49
00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You and Kanbe-san aren't
even in the same universe.

50
00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't stand a chance.

51
00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a disappointment.

52
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you'd say something
a little more clever.

53
00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here.

54
00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, okay.

55
00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It hurts!

56
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course it hurts, you idiot!

57
00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I'm not careful, you could die!

58
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to barbecue you!

59
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:34.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

60
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to roast every last piece
of your body to the bone.

61
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:46.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So? Will you do it?
Will you help me steal from Kanbe?

62
00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right then. Well, tell me
when you change your mind.

63
00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here we go!

64

65
00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this the Yamada residence?

66
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this the Yamada residence?

67
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! Can't you see that for yourself?

68
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not?

69
00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must have gotten it wrong.

70
00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry about that.

71
00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who the hell was that?

72
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, don't just stand there like an idiot.

73
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if he tells someone?

74
00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Go follow him!
-Yes, sir!

75
00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me, is this the Yamada residence?

76

Hey! Hurry up and stop him!

77

82

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We know the plate numbers and addresses
of everyone who works for us.

109
00:09:40.788 --> 00:09:45.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why I was able to send help
so quickly.

110
00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who is that person?

111
00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Onuma.

112
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Onuma?

113
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's a jack-of-all-trades of sorts.

114
00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:02.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You probably won't be seeing
him again, so forget about it.

115
00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:08.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened to Yamada-san?

116
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yamada...

117
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wish I could meet with him
and express my gratitude one more time.

118
00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:23.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After all, he's the one
who introduced you to this job.

119
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:25.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm in his debt.

120
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:30.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Kusano.
-Yes?

121
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've passed the point of no return.

122
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to put your life
on the line for this job.

123
00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:46.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't go back
to your normal life, now. So...

124
00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
now you need to do
whatever it takes to make money.

125
00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:07.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom?

126
00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:16.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey.

127
00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:18.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're alive?

128
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry for what I did.

129
00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:31.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm apologizing,
so can you call Kanbe off?

130
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know I can't do that.

131
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no going back.

132
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To what?

133
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's no going back.
-What?

134
00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:53.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's no--
-Please stop!

135
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:59.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no going back for you now.

136
00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:02.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't go back! You can't go back!

137
00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop!
-You...

138
00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
can't go back.

139
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Starting today, we're changing things.

140
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:42.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've hit seven targets this week

141
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and made 36 million yen.

142
00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:48.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our hit rate is through the roof,
thanks to the <i>new</i> register,

143
00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but at this rate,
we'll use it up in no time.

144
00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll be difficult to reach
our quota of 120 million.

145
00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:59.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's true.
We only have 400 targets left.

146
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:04.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why we're changing things. Gouriki.

147
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put aside the new contacts and go
for the seven targets we've already hit.

148
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:11.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Use the rager act to bleed them dry.

149
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fine, but if I push it too hard,
they'll go to the police.

150
00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:18.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that happens,
tell them that even if you're arrested,

151
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:21.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
your friends will go after them.

152
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if it's a bluff,
as long as we scare them, we win.

153
00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:27.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to get them to pay
as much as they can.

154
00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:31.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Got it.
-Seimiya.

155
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know the dead person scam?

156
00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:36.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've heard of it.

157
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You tell targets that their deceased
relative borrowed money, right?

158
00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:44.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. This register has the name,
death date and professions

159
00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:48.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of the targets' recently deceased
husbands and wives.

160
00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:51.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This information will definitely help.

161
00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:55.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take Kurusu and Mori and modify
the scripts from the illegitimate child

162
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and embezzlement bluffs to make it work.

163
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got it.

164
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey...

165
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:08.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This register shows how much money
some of the targets are keeping at home.

166
00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:13.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe we could lure them out of the house

167
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:16.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and go in and filch the place
as soon as they leave.

168
00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:17.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Filch"?

169
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It means rob.

170
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:23.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be an idiot.

171
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? It'll be quick.

172
00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:28.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our job is to scam people.

173
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-If we start robbing people, that's--
-A crime.

174
00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:33.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Scamming is also a crime.

175
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:37.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a business.
-Let's put that aside for now.

176
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I know a few people
who could help us out.

177
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we give them a cut, they'll do it.

178
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:47.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely not.
-Why not? It's a good idea.

179
00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:49.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't need ideas like that.

180
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:54.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We won't be using
any means outside of scamming.

181
00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:56.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Start with what I just told you.

182
00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

183
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:01.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine.

184
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:34.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Himeka?

185
00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:41.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's wrong?
-Misaki...

186
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:49.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was told not to say anything, but...

187
00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:04.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Takezo-san...
-What?

188
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did it get like this in a week?

189
00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you, I've got back pain!

190
00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:17.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if I hurt my back trying to stand up?

191
00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:20.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you take responsibility
if that happened?

192
00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But...

193
00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:27.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're just an employee,

194
00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:30.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so stop telling me what to do!
I'm paying for this!

195
00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:33.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now clean all of this up. Come on!

196
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not again...

197
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:03.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry. I did it again.

198
00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:07.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that I'm older,
I lose my temper so easily.

199
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, Kusano-san. I'm sorry!

200
00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:12.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry. It's okay.

201
00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:15.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have to clean anymore,

202
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so come here and sit with me for a bit.

203
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:22.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just clean this up real quick.

204
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's watch some TV!
Look, I have some snacks.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:30.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really, don't worry about me.

Makoto is involved with the yakuza?

212

Himeka is a bit of an airhead,
but she wouldn't make this up.

214
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should we do?

215
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Watch out!

216
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Watch where you're going, kid!
You should apologize!

217
00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:54.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, that's correct.

218
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:59.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your deceased husband has another child
who will be turning 20 this year.

219
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's very upset right now.

220
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's too loud!

221
00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:10.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry. Like I said, he's very upset,
and he says he wants to go confront you.

222
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:14.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He has a lawyer and--
-Stop whining and just pay for it!

223
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll set your house on fire!
-Excuse me...

224
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? The police?

225
00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:22.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great! I dare you to call them!

226
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know people!
-He is too loud.

227
00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:28.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If something happens to me,
they'll kill you!

228
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:33.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

229
00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:36.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right, yeah!

230
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:39.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should've said that
from the beginning!

231
00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:42.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got it!

232
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are our profits now?

233
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-About 80 million yen.
-80 million?

234
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quiet down.

235
00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:11.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Profits of 80 million in only two weeks...

236
00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:14.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're really something else, Kusano.

237
00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew you were a genius!

238
00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:19.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's 100% thanks to the <i>new</i> register.

239
00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:23.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's true. But at this rate,
we can reach our goal, right?

240
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, not necessarily.

241
00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:30.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's only 30 names left
on the <i>new</i> register.

242
00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't have many alternatives left.

243
00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:36.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we go to them like,
"We ran out of names,"

244
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they'll probably kill us.

245
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we don't do something,
we're in trouble.

246
00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:44.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll think of something.

247
00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? How do you figure?

248
00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:51.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like we can do anything
as long as we have you.

249
00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:57.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've only done boring work up until now,
and nothing ever panned out for me.

250
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:00.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I feel like anything I do
with you will succeed.

251
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:04.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to keep working with you
even if it kills me.

252
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:08.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kanbe-san said it too, right?
To do whatever we have to do.

253
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:10.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not what he meant.

254
00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:13.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Kusano.

255
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why exactly are you working so hard
at this job?

256
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:21.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

257
00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, because...
-Your dad's treatment costs?

258
00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:28.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You told me about that.
But you've already paid that off, right?

259
00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:30.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you continuing, then?

260
00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't think
about going back to normal?

261
00:22:35.812 --> 00:22:38.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Normal?
-Yeah, normal.

262
00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:43.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't go back to normal.

263
00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, I won't.

264
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some scary stuff happened,

265
00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that woke me up to reality.
There's no going back now.

266
00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:55.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm high on the adrenaline,

267
00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:59.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and like you said,
there's no other job like this.

268
00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:15.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>I probably can't quit</i>

269
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:18.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>That's right. No matter what happens...</i>

270
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:19.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

271
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Mom?

272
00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makoto. Explain this.

273
00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:08.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Okay.
