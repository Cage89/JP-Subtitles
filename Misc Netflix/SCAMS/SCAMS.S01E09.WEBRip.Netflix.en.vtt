110
00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:46.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does he ever shut up?

Makoto!

113
00:12:57.985 --> 00:12:59.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is all I have.

114
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is it?
-That's what I'm telling you!

115
00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:04.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not hiding any, are you?

116
00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:07.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you this is all I have!

117
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:08.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're really pissing me off.

118
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm busy, so get out of here!

119
00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:16.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What'd you say?
-I said get out of here, asshole!

120
00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll kill your mom!
-Shut up!

121
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:40.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She said the baby was just born.
-Is that so?

122
00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:45.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've caused a lot of trouble for you.

123
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It happens all the time.

124
00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:51.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll take a little break
and then get back into it.

125
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:55.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About that...

126
00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:00.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How do you feel about being the leader?
-What?

127
00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much!

128
00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

129
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Thank you.

130
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much, young man.

131
00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:18.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take care.

132
00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:25.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I'm tired.

133
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of the stores and people,

134
00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm giving them to you.

135
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:34.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, I'll take care
of everything with Tojo.

136
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think?

137
00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:41.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're joking, right? Kanbe-san.

138
00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:42.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

139
00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm serious.

140
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:48.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what will you do once you quit?

141
00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Move over to the financing side?

142
00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think so.

143
00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't really thought
about it yet, but...

144
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'll try my hand at a normal job.

145
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if...

146
00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's possible to change
after all this time.

147
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll try.

148
00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:22.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, what's wrong?

149
00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:23.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Isn't it this?
-Is it?

150
00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:25.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

151
00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:37.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay?

152
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:39.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you hurt yourself?
-I'm fine, sorry.

153
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll get a towel.
-Thanks.

154
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:42.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see.

155
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Here.
-Thank you.

156
00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:01.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

157
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:06.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to quit.

158
00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:13.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't know what to do.

159
00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dad got sick,

160
00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we had no money,

161
00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I couldn't find a job.

162
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:28.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The social welfare services
did nothing to help us.

163
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I knew I needed to do something.

164
00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:35.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't want to do anything bad.

165
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just...

166
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't have a choice.

167
00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:45.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

168
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:49.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

169
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think that's right.

170
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:00.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's your dad!

182
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

186
00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You didn't only take money
from your victims...

187
00:18:07.294 --> 00:18:08.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you took their dignity!

188

189
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:12.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

194
00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:20.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
