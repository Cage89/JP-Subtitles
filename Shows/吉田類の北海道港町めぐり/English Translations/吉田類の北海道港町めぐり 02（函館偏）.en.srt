00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:04,946
The meat is so flaky

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,746
Woaah!

(pun on ika=squid, ika ni=very)

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:13,914
Was that a pun?

6
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,139
No no...

7
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:17,098
Did you just make a pun?
（Yoshida）Hahaha...

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,406
I am stuck in the whelk of laughter

00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:08,985
Rui, this is Kaisen Ichiba seafood market, not far from Hakodate Station.

49
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,533
There are many things.
（Yoshida）I see...

50
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,800
It looks totally fresh.

51
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
（Shop assistant） Like this one, which is in season right now...

52
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,866
（Yoshida） Oh, this is also splendid, isn't it, summer salmon?

53
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,691
The blue of the sea is still there.

54
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,849
It's the color of the ocean, isn't it? -This one.
（Muroya） What a beautiful color.

55
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:24,593
（Shop assistant）The fresh one is bluish like this.

56
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,935
(Yoshida) Do you know what this is?
(Muroya) What is the first character?

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,635
(Shop assistant) It's "ku".

58
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,102
（Yoshida） Kue? (longtooth grouper)
（Muroya） Kue?

59
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,094
（Shop assistant） Wrong.
(Muroya) Eh... It's not?

60
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,099
（Shop assistant）It's "Kurozoi" (black rock fish)

61
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,806
（Muroya) Rui, do you know much about fish?

62
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,231
（Yoshida）Not at all, I don't know many of the names

63
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,256
I known about eating them

64
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,346
(Narrator) Two people who specialize in eating.

65
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:50,066
Lured by delicious aromas, they move to the back of the market.

66
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,406
There you will find a luxurious gem that offers a taste of Hakodate's specialties!

67
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,186
Which shall we start with?

68
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,852
（Yoshida） Um...it's probably hot, right? (grilled scallops)

69
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:03,810
You can try first

70
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:06,053
Can't you eat hot foods？ Rui
（Yoshida）No no...

71
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,952
(Muroya) How lovely, isn't it?

72
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:14,639
Mmm!

73
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:20,772
Delicous! The meat is so tender.

74
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:25,971
（Yoshida）Ah...
（Murotani）The aroma of the seashore is so good... Delicious.

75
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:28,979
What happened?

76
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,093
An incident, an incident...

77
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,106
(Narrator) Huh? What happened?

78
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,900
The hot broth on Rui's hand...

79
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,739
But for the sake of a pub poet's pride...

80
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,113
regardless of incidents, the show must go on

81
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,899
The more you taste it the more the sweetness comes out

82
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:58,411
(Narrator)
As expected of Rui.

83
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,852
The follow-up musings were also boldly reported... or what?

84
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:06,966
Suddenly the god of puns descended upon us.

85
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,892
Is this ikameshi? (squid filled with rice)
（Shop assistant）Yes this is ikameshi

86
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
After all Hakodate is famous for ikameshi.

87
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:18,475
So this ikameshi... is...  ehm... very popular?
(pun on ika=squid, ika ni=very)

88
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:19,408
Was that a pun?

89
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,600
No no...

90
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,630
Did you just make a pun?
（Yoshida）Hahaha...

91
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,655
No I didn't

92
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,326
（Muroya）That's such a dad joke

93
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:28,718
Rui when you eat whelks you can't stop laughing

94
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:30,915
Is there some laughing potion in there?
(Yoshida) No...

95
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,535
I am stuck in the whelk of laughter
(lit. translation, untranslatable pun)

96
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,113
(Narrator) Let's finish the punny whelks there...

97
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,605
Walking further into the market...

98
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,079
（Yoshida） Uh...

99
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:48,837
(Muroya) Ah it's steaming... Rui... Hakodate's Tanabe company's

100
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:51,026
squid shumai (steamed meat dumplings)

101
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:53,173
Very famous
(Yoshida) Is it really?

102
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:57,440
（Shop assistant）Packing all the goodness of Hokkaido into one package...

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,625
（Shop assistant）We use Hokkaido wheat for the dough

104
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,253
It's not at all how it looks.

105
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:07,178
Inside, there are mostly pieces of squid.

106
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:10,339
The sweetness spreads in the mouth...

107
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:13,034
This is calling out for a drink

108
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:16,265
（Shop assistant）Mr Rui here is some white wine
I've got it for you. Here you go.

109
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,366
White wine?
（Muroya）How nice

110
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:24,646
(Narrator) Look at that!
From the tasting corner, unexpected wine!

111
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,859
Rui, how do white wine and squid shumai go together?

112
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,333
Just as I thought...
（Shop assistant）Do they match?

113
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:34,900
perfectly

114
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:39,512
(Narrator) The Hakodate tour starts with seafood and white wine

115
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,673
Next, traditional Japanese sweets

116
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:49,092
The taste of a long-established restaurant for four generations located at the foot of Mount Hakodate.

117
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,766
（Yoshida）Hello

118
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,133
（Yoshida･Muroya）
Hello

119
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,100
（Shop assistant）
Welcome

120
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:58,565
(Muroya)
There are many kinds of mochi.

121
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:04,465
（Mr. Sato)
Rather than a Japanese confectionery, my shop is really a classic... traditional mochi shop.

122
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:07,498
(Narrator) Founded in year 33 of the Meiji Era.

123
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,845
(Narrator)
A mochi shop with over 100 years of history.

124
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:16,753
Four generations of unwavering commitment to handmade products.

125
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:22,985
(Mr. Sato) We cook everything ourselves...
from boiling azuki beans to make bean paste...

126
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:25,558
to the mugwort which I go to pick myself

127
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:31,777
you know I work all day inside so it's nice to go outside and get some sun once in a while

128
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,831
(Narrator) Daifuku made from mugwort that the owner himself picked in the mountains.

129
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:41,699
Let's try it now!

130
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:51,185
（Yoshida）
What a nostalgic sweetness!

131
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:55,953
and the aroma of mugwort spreads.

132
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,075
It's like when I was a kid...

133
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,366
You know? I was born in the mountains.

134
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:03,825
I recall those days.
(Muroya) Heh heh heh...

135
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:08,560
(Narrator) And one more item.
The other item is a signature product of the store.

136
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:13,045
A gold medal winner in a national confectionary competition...

137
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,859
bekomochi (leaf shaped mochi)

138
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,146
(Muroya)
It has a slight sweetness to it.

139
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,738
The texture is really nice.

140
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:25,024
The rice is properly pounded with a pestle, so the firmness of the rice is different.

141
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,149
That one you see over there...
(Yoshida) Is it that one?

142
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,959
It's like we built this restaurant with that thing.

143
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,439
Here my mom was working...

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
（Muroya）Ah your mother?

145
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:41,191
（Mr. Sato）
and I was always following her around

146
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,666
(Narrator) A mother who has been watching over the store for many years

147
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:50,832
and inheriting the taste Hideaki Sato, the fourth generation

148
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,886
and even these hands bear witness to that history

149
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,853
See here...

150
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:01,392
the left and right are clearly different
（Yoshida）Ah...

151
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:07,352
(Mr. Sato)
Yes, it's from all the squeezing and gripping of the mochi.

152
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:11,411
It's a blessing to be able to make it even when customers come over.

153
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:16,613
(Narrator)
Mochi passed down through the hands of artisans

154
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:20,513
The taste of over 100 years of tradition.

155
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:26,499
Well then Rui, next is another handmade store but...

156
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,891
in Hakodate…
well also in Hokkaido in general, this is rare...

157
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,683
a shop that handmakes this sort of thing
（Yoshida）Ah…

158
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:34,926
By the looks of it, you can tell it's guitars, right?

159
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:38,640
（Muroya）Yes this is a store that makes handmade guitars

160
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,179
(Yoshida)
All we can do is to go in and have a peek.

161
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:42,786
(Narrator)
A handmade guitar store

162
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,719
〝Aventure Guitars〞

163
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:48,971
You can always hear the sound of guitars coming from here.

164
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,479
（Yoshida）Ah yes yes

165
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,906
(Narrator)
The Kawagoe couple is always smiling.

166
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:09,393
From Tokyo, they returned back to their hometown, Hakodate, and started this shop.

167
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:12,901

Aah the beatles

169
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,640
And the wife?
（Mrs. Kawagoe）I like Luna Sea

170
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:21,539
(Mr. Kawagoe) There is a bit of a generational gap there

171
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:25,040
（Muroya）Your wife is a bit young...
（Mr. Kawagoe）Indeed

176
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,660
（Kawagoe）
Try and make some sound

177
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:51,985
now that you've came all the way to the store
（Yoshida）Yeah

178
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:55,566
Up means higher notes right?
（Mr. Kawagoe）No

179
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,991
Huh, no?
（Yoshida）It's the same as a shamisen

180
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,050
（Muroya）So...

181
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,593
（Yoshida）Well then shall we leave?

182
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:10,863

（Yoshida）It's nice

This is a major checkpoint for Rui, who is also a tourism ambassador for Kochi Prefecture!

188
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,199
But it's about time for a drink.

189
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:48,885

(Narrator) Port Town Hakodate Tour with Rui Yoshida
Where is the next stop?

194
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,133
I will just go ahead and take a seat here...

195
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:26,466
( Muroya) It looks... a lot like my grandma's house.

196
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,566
(Yoshida) The glass in the front is from the Taisho era.

197
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,719
How do you know?
（Yoshida）The quiver...

198
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,585
(Muroya)
Eh... Taisho era?

199
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,210

Taisho era glass.

201
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,257
somehow nostalgic Taisho glass

202
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:44,440
It's like we've suddenly stepped back in time. This is...

203
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,498
a Spanish style bar
La Concha

204
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:51,786
First floor is Japanese style
Second floor is Western style

205
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,252
A store with an evocative and elegant atmosphere.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,833
The house where the owner-chef was born.

207
00:12:57,033 --> 00:13:01,000
a rice wholesale store converted into a Spanish-style bar

208
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:05,246
（Bartender）
Here you go

209
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:06,838

215
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,665
Ah... lightly seasoned

216
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:46,939
They are all very friendly flavours

217
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:50,219
Maybe it's the chef's personality that is coming out

218
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:54,120
(Narrator) Dishes that show the personality of the chef.

219
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:59,902
This one, cod and clams in a parsley sauce is also an unmissable recommendation

220

Ah hello

221
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:07,365
（Mr. Fukaya）Um, south Hokkaido, Hakodate's pride, "King Shiitake" mushroom

222
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,928
（Yoshida）
When I said that the personality is showing in the dishes...

223
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:12,519
I thought it might be someone with this kind of face.

224
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,470
exactly like this
（Mr. Fukaya）Ah is that so?

225
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:19,833
(Narrator)
The dish that is the pride of Mr. Fukaya who was just as imagined

226
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,693
King shiitake mushroom ajillo

227
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:29,058
Mr. Fukuda in Nanae Town produces shiitake mushrooms of the size you see!

228
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:31,692
Called "King shiitake" mushroom

229
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,325
It is a hidden specialty of Hakodate!

230
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,083
Now, how does it taste?

231
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:44,286
So much of the fresh flavour remains

232
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,852
(Muroya) Delicious!
（Yoshida）Right?

233
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,286
(Mr. Fukaya) Old people can't eat steak anymore. Their teeth are too weak.

234
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:52,313
I made this to be a replacement for that.

235
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,925
（Muroya）The cured ham also...
（Yoshida）Yeah…

236
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,989
(Mr. Fukaya) This we've been making ourselves for 28 years.

237
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,714
It's a little less salty than the Spanish...

238
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:04,813
you can feel the sweetness
（Yoshida）I can feel it

239
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:08,626
(Narrator) 28 years of making cured ham

240
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:12,412
A carefully crafted product with a hint of sweetness.

241
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:17,139
Aged slowly for 1 year and 4 months

242
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:20,098
The umami flavor is brought out to the maximum extent possible!

243
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,826
(Muroya) Mr. Fukaya, did you live in Spain?

244
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,718
I, um... about 37 years ago...

245
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,779
I was in a town in the Basque Country called San Sebastian.

246
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:33,004
I've been training there for three years.
Right over there.

247
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,662
（Yoshida）I thought this was the night view of Hakodate.

248
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,987
(Muroya)
But it looks very similar to Hakodate.

249
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:43,804
But returning to your hometown, and serving up more and more of this incredible and authentic food....

250
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:45,891
A society that forms relations over drinks

251
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:49,821
Well, in other words, Hakodate's ability to integrate with

252
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:53,584
the Spanish drinking culture is one of the
most profound things about Hakodate, after all.

253
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,712
Ah~... this.
What are you drinking?

254
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:00,204
(Woman) Sangria.
(Yoshida) Ah...

255
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:02,796
It's delicious, too.

256
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,833
I love the Basque Country in Spain.

257
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,958
（Woman）Every year I go two times

258
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:08,959
(Muroya)
Eh~! Is that so?

259
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,186
(Yoshida) Cheers...

260
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,146
 Oh... a married couple?
(Woman) Yes, we are.

261
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,838
(Muroya)
Did you meet in Japan?

262
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:18,824
Yes, yes, here.

263
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,816
Here in Hakodate
(Man) In Hakodate

264
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:28,026
(Narrator) Cross-border socializing
And encounters, and good drinks...

265
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:30,712
make Hakodate nights fun!

266
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,811
(Muroya) What is it about Hakodate that attracts you to the city?

267
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:38,863
I think this place has
that kind of atmosphere

268
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:41,341
that is closer to Europe than Tokyo.

269
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,575
For example, in front of this Kanamori warehouse cluster.

270
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,366
If you go up this hill, there's a church here.

271
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:47,458
(Yoshida) The history is amazing, isn't it?

272
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,416
( Mr. Fukaya )
A little Western excitement.

273
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,693
...with an air of romance.

274
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,984
I think that's nice, you know.

330
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,125
Not included.
Not included.

331
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,546
(Narrator)
2,000 to 2,500 yen for a box of sea urchins

332
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,986
Mmm... how delightful.

333
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,106
This is grilled miso clams
(Muroya) Ah!

334
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:51,864
I love these!
(Mr. Ookubo)
Oh, really?

335
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,918
(Yoshida)
And what kind of song does this include...

336
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:56,108
(singing do-re-mi off-key)

337
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,608
...or something like that?
(Muroya) I don't need that one.

338
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,767
(Mr. Ookubo)
Okay... hahahahaha!

339
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:04,773
(Narrator)
Popular in Kanako Muroya's hometown Tsugaru region

340
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,064
Grilled beach specialties

341
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,889
Finally, a beaten egg is a nice touch.

342
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,920
This is delicious (in Tsugaru dialect)

343
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:16,632
（Yoshida.)
"This is something rare...?"

344
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,499
“I'll eat it after all.”
(Muroya) I said “It looks delicious.”

345
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,553
Is it good (again in Tsugaru dialect)?
（Yoshida）It's good

346
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,292
Isn't it great fun?

347
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,100
(Muroya)
Singing...
Singing songs I didn't ask order...

348
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
(Yoshida) It's good.
（Muroya) It's good. It's soothing.

349
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Here's the thing.
I got fired from my last company.

350
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,366
(Muroya) Hahahaha!

351
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:39,791
(Mr. Ookubo)
This is a Hokkaido “Kunimare” dry sake.

352
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:42,853
（Yoshida)
This is bold, isn't it?

353
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:47,466
（Muroya）Tasty?

354
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,626
Delicious.
(Muroya) Ahhh...

355
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,179
That's nice.
(Yoshida) This is...

356
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:54,638
It's a shame to spill it.

357
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,086
I just can't help it. I have to go over here...

358
00:20:58,408 --> 00:20:59,775
(Man)
Thank you very much.

359
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,566
（Muroya）Good evening

360
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:05,679
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

361
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,173
(Woman)
My younger sister and daughter...

362
00:21:09,412 --> 00:21:11,645
Do you want some of this?

363
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,200
She's 22 years old.

364
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:16,891
So she likes to drink.
（Yoshida) Oh, you're 22?

365
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,752
Eh! Hey, look at this.

366
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:22,244
That's amazing... Mother...

367
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:23,569
That's good education.

368
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:27,126
The parent is drinking barley tea.

369
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:31,159
"Yamabuki" 's recommendations of today is...

370
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:35,492
Is the Hakodate stable over them all, squid sashimi

371
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:38,045
Rui, how is the taste?

372
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:41,678
This crispy feeling.

373
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:44,819
I really have never eaten squid this crunchy before!

374
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:46,333
(Muroya)
and the Mrs...

375
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,191
What kind of a person is your husband?

376
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:50,216
（Chiyoko）
A person that is fun to be around I think

377
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:51,675
(Muroya)
Oh, that's nice...

378
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,400
How nice!
(Muroya)
How nice

379
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:56,792
(Ookubo-san)
It was a workplace marriage. The Maritime Self-Defense Force.

380
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,983
(Muroya) What? Self-Defense Forces?
(Ookubo-san)
Yes, from 18.

381
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:02,908
(Yoshida)
Both of you were in the Maritime Self-Defense Force? Wow...

382
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:05,239
so I've been in the nightlife business for a long time 
(slang for nightlife business is "water trade")

383
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:07,031
(Yoshida).
So to speak, “at sea”...

384
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,420
It's here.
（Yoshida.)
Here it comes!

385
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,560
(Kanako's haiku)

386
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,766
breezes of early summer

387
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,060
breezes of early summer
The seagull's troubles...

388
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,471
breezes of early summer
The seagull's troubles...
I wonder what they are.

389
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,026
I don't think seagulls have any troubles.
(Muroya) Haha!

390
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:27,653
If you give me an answer there, it's done...
I don't even know if there is one.

391
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:30,078
No, they don't.
They live by instinct.

392
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:35,501
(Worrying seagull pun)

393
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,459
(Narrator)
Now then, Rui, if you please.

394
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,083
A Summer Night's

395
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:50,837
(Rui's haiku)

396
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,556
A Summer Night's
Illumination

397
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:50,522
A Summer Night's
Illumination
Bay Area

398
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,475
One more time please

399
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
（Yoshida）Sorry

400
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,999
Uhm...
If I have to tell it twice...

401
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:01,506
I guess that means it's still a bad piece of work on top of being drunk.

402
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:02,931
No, no, no...

403
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:06,686
Um... I don't mean to impress anyone.
Not today.

404
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,419
I'd rather enjoy myself.

405
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,053
(Mr. Ookubo)
Sake is also delicious... (singing)

406
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:21,211
(Narrator)
Good food, sake, songs and haiku

407
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:24,839
No, “fun” is the most important thing!

408
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:30,766
Hakodate Port Town Walk in Hokkaido with Rui Yoshida

409
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:36,492
Well, which port town shall we go to next?
