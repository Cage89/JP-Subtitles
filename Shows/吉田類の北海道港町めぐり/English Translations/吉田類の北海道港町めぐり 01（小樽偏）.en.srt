（Yoshida）Ah its candy
（Muroya）Candy?

00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.439

A candy stall…
（Yoshida）That's the first time I've seen something like that.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.800

（Muroya）Right.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.066
（Yoshida）It's almost as if you were born to be a candy seller.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:25.633
（Mrs Ametani）Indeed.

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:27.300

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.821

（Yoshida･Muroya）Hello!
（Mrs Ametani）I am a candy seller.

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:39.202
（Woman）It's a nostalgic feeling, sweet but not too sweet.

00:04:39.227 --> 00:04:41.794
But it tastes kind of comforting.

00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:47.108 line:20%
（Narrator）
The candy with the conforting flavour is the Yukitan (snow coal) candy.

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:55.359 line:20%
Snow piling on top of coal in candy form, it is the taste of Hokkaido in winter.

00:04:56.128 --> 00:05:02.689
（Muroya） So, Rui, there's a shop around here that's got the perfect snacks for drinks.

00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:07.787
This is this place that is already famous in Otaru, Kamaei, selling Kamaboko fish cakes.

00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:09.812
（Yoshida）Yes I can see it from the sign already, Kamaei.

00:05:09.837 --> 00:05:12.237

secret gourmet menus are found on the menu!

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:33.282
（Muroya）This is the bread roll you're famous for, isn't it?

00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:38.623
（Shop assistant）Inside the surimi, there's minced meat, onions and pepper,

00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:41.015
（Shop assistant）It's rolled up in a thin slice of bread and deep-fried.

00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:43.949
Mmm!

00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:46.508
I'm sorry I suddently feel like drinking wine.

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:48.333
Aah wine is it?

00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:53.267
（Narrator）Kamaei kamaboko fish cakes made from fish from nearby waters.

00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:58.575
The same deliciousness unchanged since the founding in 1905.

00:05:59.262 --> 00:06:01.728 line:20%
The bread roll that even surprises Rui.

00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:08.648 line:20%
In 1962, the company head wanted to eat kamaboko in snack form...

00:06:08.673 --> 00:06:11.206 line:20%
... and from that idea this food item came into being.

00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:17.189
As local delivery is not possible, many fans come to the shop in search of the freshly fried food.

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.808
(Woman) Bread roll.
（Yoshida）Oh, I knew it. The bread roll.

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:25.368
So you are going with the bread roll?
（Woman）Ah yes the bread roll.

00:06:26.654 --> 00:06:28.287 line:20%
（Narrator）
Apart from the bread roll

00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:33.170 line:20%
the mayo sandwich where mayonnaise and hot peppers are
the key ingredients is also popular.

00:06:33.888 --> 00:06:39.280 line:20%
These fried fish cakes are a regular side dish for the locals.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.908
Miso nanban?
（Yoshida）Huh?

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:46.400
“Pungently spicy, scallions” also “with chili”

00:06:46.642 --> 00:06:50.742
This, also, would go well with a drink.
（Yoshida）Aah I want to go for it.

00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:57.292
It's obvious that you feel like drinking after these snacks.

00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:00.793 line:20%
（Yoshida） I'd like to taste a bit of the miso flavour.

00:07:04.135 --> 00:07:06.220 line:20%
Ah slightly sweet...

00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:09.212 line:20%
I want to pair this with dry sake.

00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:13.970
This, the taste of the miso paste, the aroma spreads in the mouth so much.

00:07:14.747 --> 00:07:18.008
Yes, the taste of the miso too, but...

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:20.058
also the spiciness of the chili...

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:23.362
（吉田）Uhm...sorry can you also do my "Wandering Pub Diary" show for me as well?

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:34.333
(Narrator) After Otaru's famous fish cakes, is it time to get some of you know what Rui?

00:07:34.564 --> 00:07:37.231
（Yoshida）This place is pretty spacious, isn't it?

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:39.622
What?
There's some kind of food stall village over there.

00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:43.488
（Yoshida）Now this is...
（Muroya）How nice!

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:45.917

00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:49.181 line:50%
（Muroya）
Ah Rui, I was wondering when you would say that.

00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:50.306

00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:53.137
（Yoshida）This is "Brick Valley" isn't it.

00:07:53.162 --> 00:07:55.272

00:07:58.048 --> 00:07:59.982 line:20%
（Narrator）
The sun is starting to set...

00:08:00.007 --> 00:08:02.774 line:20%
Now to the real food stalls.

（Mr Arasawa）
Buona sera!

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:10.410

（Narrator）At the bar, greeting local regulars.

00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:40.515
This is Rui Yoshida's toast.

00:08:44.108 --> 00:08:44.977
Delicious, isn't it?

00:08:45.362 --> 00:08:47.776
It's nice, isn't it? It's so refreshing.

00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:49.901
（Mr Arasawa) This is a white whelk from Yoichi.

00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:53.662
Steamed in white wine, whirling them out and eat them.

00:08:55.668 --> 00:09:02.305 line:20%
（Yoshida） Still some firmness left… and washing down with refreshing sparkling…

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.762

(Narrator) The snacks start at 200 yen per plate.

00:09:08.807 --> 00:09:10.973
Pleasantly priced Italian food.

The owner mixes Otaru ingredients with his own taste from his travels in Italy.

00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:20.929
Here are intense flavours.

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.996
（Muroya） What is this black stuff?

00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:28.621
（Mr Arasawa）This is garlic from Akaigawa but,

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:33.735
We keep them in a rice cooker on the "keep warm" setting.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.260
..for 20 hours
（Muroya）What?!

00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:38.215
And then they become like this

00:09:38.288 --> 00:09:39.479
（Yoshida）Ah this is dried up.

00:09:39.504 --> 00:09:41.371
（Muroya）Ah but the inside is a bit soft.

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:42.962
You need a bit of courage to eat it.

00:09:42.987 --> 00:09:46.155
（Yoshida）Ah this is sweet isn't it?

00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:46.717
（Mr Arasawa）Yes it's sweet

00:09:46.742 --> 00:09:48.975
It smells a bit of pistacchio

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.360
（Yoshida）Yeah!

00:09:51.393 --> 00:09:55.379
It's the first time I try this.

00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:56.671

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:11.361
（Yoshida）You're a bit of a connoisseur, aren't you?

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:16.477 line:20%
The more I go to Italy, the more I like this kind of thing.

00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:18.169 line:20%
This sort of style.

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:22.302
That thing over there is a bit different from the counter, isn't it?

00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:25.779
（Muroya）They are waving at us.

00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:28.009
Good evening, what's that over there?

00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:31.467
That counter, what are you selling?

00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:34.592
（Mr Sanada）This is sort of a sushi place.
（Muroya）A sushi place!

00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:39.127
（Narrator）A sushi counter inside an Italian restaurant?

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:42.680 line:20%
The keyword you can't miss when talking about Otaru is ‘sushi’.

00:10:43.095 --> 00:10:45.195 line:20%
Umm... I'm curious!

Rengayokocho (Brick Alley) Italian restaurant with an unexpected discovery.

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:16.548
（Muroya）Good evening, what's that over there?

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:21.042
That counter, what are you selling?

00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:24.435
（Mr Sanada）This is sort of a sushi place.
（Muroya）A sushi place!

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.719
(Narrator) Wow what a surprise - beyond the counter of the Italian bar - is a sushi restaurant!

00:11:31.614 --> 00:11:33.081
（Yoshida）You can also eat there?

00:11:33.106 --> 00:11:35.839
That's right, but the business is completely separate.

00:11:36.088 --> 00:11:37.988
May I take something from there?
（Mr Arasawa）By all means.

00:11:38.013 --> 00:11:39.979
I would like some sushi!
（Mr Sanada）Sushi yes!

00:11:40.102 --> 00:11:41.168
Ehm is 6 pieces alright?

00:11:41.193 --> 00:11:42.869
（Yoshida）6 pieces please
（Mr Sanada）Understood

00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:50.953 line:20%
 (TN) Untranslatable joke, "sixth sense" and "the sixth piece (of sushi)" is pronounced the same in Japanese

00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:44.988
Somehow, with my sixth sense...

00:11:45.013 --> 00:11:48.146

（Men in the back, laughing）“Sixth sense”

00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:50.638
There it is, the old man joke.

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:54.208

While the sushi is being made, Rui adds some white wine.

00:12:07.982 --> 00:12:11.973
Still, I was surprised to find such a fun place to eat, you know.

00:12:12.108 --> 00:12:14.108
(Muroya) We're very close to the other customers.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:17.333
（Mr Arasawa）That's right.
They gradually mingle like this.

00:12:20.768 --> 00:12:23.068
（Muroya）Ah! Rui, the sushi...

00:12:23.195 --> 00:12:26.295
（Mr Sanada）Sushi
（Yoshida）This is amazing

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.487
（Muroya）Otaru is famous for sushi, isn't it?

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.815
I think I'll get on the bandwagon and have a glass of white wine.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.840
White wine, yes! White, please.
（Mr Arasawa）Understood!

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:39.354
（Yoshida）Hehe, this is an interesting combination.

00:12:42.354 --> 00:12:46.021

00:12:56.882 --> 00:12:59.182
（Muroya） I think I'll have the salmon roe, then.

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:04.362
Mmm!

00:13:06.929 --> 00:13:09.229
Delicious with a pop.

00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:12.895
Rui-san, I've never had sake and wine together before.

00:13:13.128 --> 00:13:15.828
No, no, no, it's, um, sushi and wine isn't it?

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:17.320
Ahh haha...

00:13:17.915 --> 00:13:20.281
What did I just say?
（Yoshida）Sake and wine.

00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:21.629
（Muroya）Excuse me.

00:13:22.714 --> 00:13:26.514
I'm getting a bit drunk.

00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:29.020
I'm having fun.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:32.501
（Yoshida）With this kind of vibe... I can't turn back now.
（Mr Sanada）You can't turn back now?

00:13:32.526 --> 00:13:35.159
Can I order a few more?

00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:36.335
Yes

00:13:37.542 --> 00:13:40.275
(Applause)
(Sanada) Thank you very much.

00:13:41.434 --> 00:13:42.901

00:13:43.702 --> 00:13:45.335
（Man）Rui!

00:13:45.675 --> 00:13:49.320
Just... just for a minute, let's go toast over there.

00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:50.120
(Muroya) Yeah, right.

00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.712
（Yoshida）Oh, here... here, it's a different atmosphere.

00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:55.268

00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:56.195

Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you...

00:13:57.993 --> 00:13:59.493
What are you drinking?

00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:02.548
（Man）Potato spirits on the rock …
(Mr Sanada) Potato on the rocks there it is!

00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:03.806
（Muroya）Potato on the rocks, very nice!

00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:06.176
It's alright its only the sixth cup
（Mr Sanada）“Only” hahaha...

00:14:06.528 --> 00:14:09.361
（Yoshida）Nice mood.
（Muroya）Right? Fun.

00:14:09.455 --> 00:14:14.180
（Mr Arasawa）It's... but, you know, when you do it every night, you can't stop.
It's... it's fun.

00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:17.428
(Muroya) Chef!
What is your recommendation?

00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:19.868
It's already ready.
（Muroya）Thank you!

00:14:20.022 --> 00:14:21.855

00:14:32.098 --> 00:14:34.675
（Narrator）Truly sushi art!

00:14:35.595 --> 00:14:38.895
The head chefs seasonal 3 nigiri recommendations.

00:14:39.114 --> 00:14:41.181
Stunning workmanship.

00:14:48.574 --> 00:14:51.641
You know, when it comes to this...

00:14:53.048 --> 00:14:56.048
It's OK without any comments, you know?

00:14:56.255 --> 00:14:58.122
（Muroya）Abashiri herring

00:15:01.408 --> 00:15:03.875

（Muroya）Delicious (in Aomori dialect)!

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:11.107
（Yoshida）
“Delicious”  (in Aomori dialect)

00:15:11.132 --> 00:15:13.832
that means "This is a rare delicacy."

00:15:13.857 --> 00:15:15.723
This is Aomori dialect.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:19.089
（Muroya）It's incredibly fatty and delicious.

00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:21.082
This is... Otaru... you know...

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:23.128
（Mr Arasawa）Spear squid
（Yoshida）Yes

00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:28.448

（Yoshida）Um...
We went to eat Otaru candy.

00:16:00.682 --> 00:16:02.663
（Muroya）We did.
（Yoshida）There's a food stall.

00:16:02.688 --> 00:16:04.821
（Mr Arasawa）It was raining in the morning.

00:16:04.846 --> 00:16:08.179
（Muroya）Yes, that's right!
（Yoshida）Ah, you understood very well.

00:16:08.204 --> 00:16:11.304
It's a play on the words ‘candy’ and ‘rain’...
You know what I mean!

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:15.295
I love it.
（Laughter）

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.923
This is a problem, isn't it?
（Muroya）It's getting fun...

00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:22.115
(Narrator) When the lanterns are lit.

00:16:22.729 --> 00:16:26.195
The town of Otaru is tinged with laughter.

00:16:26.697 --> 00:16:28.663

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:43.906 line:20%
I'll translate it for you now...

00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:48.989
（Yoshida）Well, that was some fun, that standing bar.

00:16:49.014 --> 00:16:51.147
It was!
（Yoshida）I mean...

00:16:51.172 --> 00:16:55.206
I feel like I want to spread that sort of thing across the country already.

00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:57.297
It's still early.
（Muroya）Yes.

00:16:58.348 --> 00:17:00.048
Here!
（Yoshida）Here also, still...

00:17:00.073 --> 00:17:04.006
Look at this place, too, how different it looks.

00:17:04.031 --> 00:17:06.031
It's “Ponkasu” right?
（Muroya）It's not “Ponkasu”

00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:07.522
It's “Sukanpo”
（Yoshida）Ah “Sukanpo”

00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:09.581
It's reverse
（Yoshida）Ah I see.

00:17:20.153 --> 00:17:21.153
（Man）Not at all.
（Yoshida）Sorry.

00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:22.645
（Muroya）Excuse me.

00:17:24.428 --> 00:17:25.461
（Mr Tayama）Thrice poured...

00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:27.686
（Yoshida）Huh？ This, thrice poured, what is that?

00:17:27.711 --> 00:17:28.778
（Muroya）Thrice poured?

00:17:29.028 --> 00:17:30.495
（Mr Tayama）It will take a bit of time

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.420
（Muroya）How long?

00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:33.245
(Mr Tayama)
It will take 5 min.

00:17:33.389 --> 00:17:37.122
(Narrator) Three times poured beer that takes five minutes to complete.

00:17:38.221 --> 00:17:41.388
Even a pub connoisseurs like Rui has never heard of this menu.

00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:44.308
What on earth is it?

00:17:45.155 --> 00:17:48.822
He just drew it a bit like this and then left it...

00:17:49.542 --> 00:17:51.575
Is that the first pour?

00:17:52.148 --> 00:17:54.381
Yes that's the first pour...

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.508
(Narrator) First there's the first pour.

00:17:59.381 --> 00:18:04.081
It's going to take a while, so Rui's party ordered some other beers.

00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:06.262
Here, too, it's also...

00:18:08.301 --> 00:18:10.735
（Yoshida）May I?
Excuse me. Thank you very much.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.526
（Customers）Cheers！

00:18:14.543 --> 00:18:15.910
（Yoshida）Hello

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:19.428
（Muroya）Just now, it's the second pour.
It takes time...

00:18:19.453 --> 00:18:21.886
（Yoshida）This will probably take until tomorrow.

00:18:23.768 --> 00:18:26.068
(Narrator) It's five minutes, five minutes.

00:18:27.115 --> 00:18:29.048
(Yoshida) There are things like bacon steaks

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.780
（Mr Tayama）It's from a place called Akaigawa Village, and they use Kurobuta pork...

00:18:31.805 --> 00:18:33.839
It's aged bacon, but ...

00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:35.987
Can I go to the bathroom first?

00:18:36.012 --> 00:18:39.079
Haha... bathroom? Please, by all means...

00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:41.004
I don't think it's done yet.

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:44.052
It's not good for you to hold it in, you know, so please, go ahead...

00:18:44.187 --> 00:18:45.954
Has the third pour happened yet?
（Mr Tayama）It's done!

00:18:45.986 --> 00:18:48.853
（Muroya）Is it done? Oh, I see!

00:18:49.307 --> 00:18:51.774
Then let's just say it's not done yet.

00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:54.168
No, it's a drink that doesn't work like that.

00:18:54.193 --> 00:18:57.260
（Muroya）Rui's gone to the bathroom. What should I do...

00:18:57.285 --> 00:19:02.434
This! This is the rumoured three-times-poured beer.

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:04.909
I think I'll have a drink. Sorry about that, Rui.

00:19:12.188 --> 00:19:15.455
Aah! It different isn't it?
（Mr Tayama）Yes

00:19:16.028 --> 00:19:18.861
Um... mellow...
（Mr Tayama）Yes, that is right.

00:19:18.886 --> 00:19:22.153
Delicious bubbles that go right into your mouth!

00:19:22.775 --> 00:19:25.208
Rui quickly! Isn't he done yet?

00:19:25.233 --> 00:19:26.833
The bubbles are disappearing...

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:31.169 line:20%
（Narrator）
First pour… second pour…

00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:32.800 line:20%
Third pour

00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:36.149 line:20%
The beer that takes time to finish is...

00:19:36.382 --> 00:19:38.282 line:20%
Moderately decarbonated.

00:19:38.307 --> 00:19:40.774 line:20%
enhancing the taste of the beer.

00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:46.475
A gem of a drink, even if you have to wait a long time for it.

00:19:49.049 --> 00:19:52.315
Oh, Rui, I'm sorry I drank before you.

00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:54.835
This is the three times poured?
（Muroya）This is it

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.561
Once again...
（Yoshida）Well then...

00:19:56.586 --> 00:19:57.753
（Yoshida･Muroya）Cheers!

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:03.088
Wow, it's super creamy!

00:20:03.113 --> 00:20:06.780
Isn't this like a beer that's meant to be drunk for this foam? This ...

00:20:06.935 --> 00:20:09.302
（Muroya）Ah… wow!！
（Yoshida）Oh...

00:20:09.514 --> 00:20:11.114
Ah, I knew it...

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.045 line:20%
Right? It's beautiful.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.204 line:20%
（Mr Tayama）Thank you very much.

00:20:16.117 --> 00:20:17.917 line:20%
Well, it's bacon and eggs.

00:20:17.942 --> 00:20:21.175 line:20%
We use natural eggs from Yoichi.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.800
（Muroya）Wait, this yolk!

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:26.825
The yolk is very...
（Yoshida）It's full of sun.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.740
It's full of sun.…
Given the name “Full of sun.”

00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:31.419
Given the name “Full of sun.”

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:35.409
（Muroya）
I've never had such thick bacon before!

00:20:40.622 --> 00:20:42.462 line:20%
It's very delicious (Aomori dialect)

00:20:42.624 --> 00:20:44.710 line:20%
It's super duper delicious (even more Aomori dialect)

00:20:44.766 --> 00:20:46.800 line:20%
I'll translate it for you now...

00:20:47.002 --> 00:20:49.402 line:20%
‘You... you don't get to eat this very often’.

00:20:49.427 --> 00:20:51.760 line:20%
‘Such a delicious taste’...

00:20:52.288 --> 00:20:53.521
Goo!
（Mr Tayama）Thank you very much!

00:20:53.592 --> 00:20:54.659
（Yoshida）Is it okay without translating that?

00:20:54.684 --> 00:20:57.151
That was standard Japanese just now.

00:20:57.942 --> 00:21:01.508
(Narrator) Handmade taste, painstakingly produced on the farm.

00:21:01.895 --> 00:21:05.162
Aged bacon steaks from Kurobuta pork

00:21:07.168 --> 00:21:09.835
（Mr Tayama）The yolk's colour changes with the seasons.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.194
鶏たちが食べる餌が変わるので
（Yoshida･Muroya）Really?!

00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:16.386
（Mr Tayama）Right now they eat a lot of pumpkins, leftover pumpkin...

00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:18.229
（Yoshida）And that's why there's this yellow colour...

00:21:18.254 --> 00:21:20.121
If it's like this then...

00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:23.879
I gradually feel like order more from the menu.

00:21:24.081 --> 00:21:24.881
Thank you very much

00:21:25.186 --> 00:21:27.019
（Muroya）What are you eating?

00:21:27.044 --> 00:21:29.344
（Man）It's kakuni (stew of cubed ingredients)
（Muroya）Wow, looks tasty!

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.455
（Man）Tanaka kakuni

00:21:31.602 --> 00:21:34.035
（Muroya）What was that?
（Man）Haha, I'm sorry...

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.294
（吉田）Well then, can you just confirm one more time

00:21:36.318 --> 00:21:38.552 line:20%
（TN）Pun, kakuni stew and confirm is pronounced similarly

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:39.452
（Man）Aah...

00:21:40.228 --> 00:21:43.328
Oh, boy.
（Muroya）Oh, my God, they're all drunk.

00:21:45.275 --> 00:21:49.208
(Narrator) Kakuni, a classic Japanese dish of stewed pork!

00:21:50.662 --> 00:21:54.028
And speaking of ‘sukampo’ specialities, here is one!

00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:57.782 line:20%
Soba-rice with lots of sauce

00:21:57.902 --> 00:21:59.268 line:20%
How does it taste?

00:21:59.882 --> 00:22:01.882 line:20%
（Yoshida）This soba-rice

00:22:02.115 --> 00:22:04.248
（Mr Tayama）Originally a food from the Kobe area.

00:22:04.273 --> 00:22:06.640
I was over there for a while.

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:08.358
It was delicious at the time, so...

00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:11.162
I'd really like to adopt it in my own shop.

00:22:11.187 --> 00:22:12.853
Yakisoba, rice and...

00:22:13.694 --> 00:22:14.528
（Yoshida）Mm!

00:22:15.989 --> 00:22:18.222
Mmm!
(Muroya) Mmm!

00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:24.542
（Yoshida）It's beautifully presented.
（Mr Tayama）Hahaha...

00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:26.781
This is so refined.
（Muroya）Very refined!

00:22:27.108 --> 00:22:28.575
（Customers）Cheers!

00:22:28.688 --> 00:22:30.888
（Muroya）So you are not from Otaru?

00:22:30.913 --> 00:22:33.180
（Mr Tayama）Correct
（Muroya）What brought you to Otaru?

00:22:33.205 --> 00:22:35.638 line:20%
On a journey.
（室谷）On a journey?

00:22:35.783 --> 00:22:37.950 line:20%
Yeah, I was just dropping by.

00:22:38.268 --> 00:22:39.801
And I liked it very much.

00:22:39.935 --> 00:22:43.435
I opened the shop to live in Otaru...

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.993
I think we're the same.

00:22:45.928 --> 00:22:49.762
Um... please be my friend.

00:22:50.668 --> 00:22:54.635
Master and Rui both love Hokkaido.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.526
Right right.
I think so.

00:22:58.455 --> 00:22:59.355
Ah, master.

00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:01.475
Oh, thank you very so much for today.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.900
No, no, thank you.

After this, at night in Otaru Rui Yoshida's haiku.

00:23:17.161 --> 00:23:20.161
These bubbles...
These bubbles... for these bubbles...

00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:29.313
New sake when the tongue is smacking, God's dance (haiku)
 - Rui Yoshida

00:23:29.888 --> 00:23:32.688
There's a friend on the other side of this drink...

00:23:32.775 --> 00:23:33.842 line:20%
（Muroya）Aa…

00:23:34.435 --> 00:23:36.169 line:20%
This makes you happy, doesn't it?

00:23:36.194 --> 00:23:39.694 line:20%
That's deep, isn't it? I didn't think of it that way at all.

00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:41.219 line:20%
I was just drinking...

00:23:41.408 --> 00:23:43.874 line:20%
No, from now on, you have to feel it.

00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:45.199 line:20%
You don't have to think about it.

00:23:45.224 --> 00:23:47.158 line:20%
You feel it.
（Yoshida）Feel it.

00:23:47.183 --> 00:23:50.683 line:20%
（Narrator）
Good drinks and good food.

00:23:51.622 --> 00:23:55.189 line:20%
We enjoyed the port town of Otaru.
